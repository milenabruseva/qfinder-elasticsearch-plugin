&#x200B;

I was in my early teens during the '08 crisis. I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.

Those close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.

To Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.

To CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/). They include, but are not limited to, **IBM**, **Cisco**, **TMobile**, **JPMorgan**, **Oracle**, and **ZipRecruiter**. Their parent company is [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal), owned by **Comcast** and **GE**.

To the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these ""millennial blog posts"": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? *We're not enemies, we're on the same side*. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.

To WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.

We're suffering from success and our Discord was the first casualty. You know as well as I do that if you gather 250k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad. That room was golden and the people that run it are awesome. We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you don't get to hang out with your friends anymore. Discord did us dirty and **I am not impressed with them destroying our community** instead of stepping in with the wrench we may have needed to fix things, especially after we got over 1,000 server boosts. That is pretty unethical.

To add to this, people are co-opting our name on twitter. I won't mention their accounts, but lots of handles with ""wsb"" and ""wallstreetbets"" in them are pretending to speak for us. They're saying things that we don't agree with, driving traffic to derivative communities and shitty pixelated merch stores, and generally making it harder for us to define who we are. There's also too much political bullshit in a community that was never *ever* political. The only way I want to occupy Wall St is in a suit myself or rent-free in the mind of a blown up short.

That is why I'm throwing my support behind the Twitter handle in general. We need a way to PUBLICLY reach out to the staff of the infrastructure that is failing us so the world can see that we aren't doing anything wrong here if they don't respond. We need to be able to respond directly to a reporter that is lying to the world about our clubhouse. We can't be expected to meet any expectations when we aren't given the tools we need.

In fact, I bought some $GME puts (which I've since sold since somehow they've gone up based on volatility) betting against the crowd here.

However, what has started as a decentralized short squeeze has morphed into a class movement. I'm a big populist and think we need big changes in this country, especially a transfer of wealth and power from the elites to the people. When this morphed into a class movement I became obsessed. However, I still wasn't going to buy in because I shy away from speculating on ultra risky stuff like this. But when Robinhood and all the other major brokerages colluded to cause a massive sell off, that's when it became a matter of principle. I've watched all day as the stock has remained relatively stable on very little volume.

9,30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb,66433,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/,8475,"I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.  

Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: 

__We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.__ Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1.	⁠Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.
2.	⁠Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.
3.	⁠Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.
4.	⁠Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.
5.	⁠At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.
6.	⁠Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.
7.	⁠The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  

__I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user ([u/zshub](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/gl5vgof/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)) who said a market sell order executed at $2600 for him.  Also, someone else for over [$5,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7em07/coworker_had_a_limit_executed_of_a_little_over/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) per share. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?__ It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

[Listen to this ](https://youtu.be/7RH4XKP55fM)to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

__TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.__

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.

I just have a knack for explaining things and lots of people have asked about this topic so I thought I’d share my own personal thoughts.**

# The bull thesis

To date, the GME play has been pretty simple: buy and hold and wait for the squeeze, whether that comes in hours, days, or weeks. Try not to have a heart attack during the intermittent gamma squeezes, keep your hands diamond strong during the manipulated downward spikes, and buy baby buy.

It’s rapidly becoming apparent that we will soon enter the GME endgame. Before you can come up with an exit strategy or, if you’re still on the fence, decide whether to jump in, you need to form an opinion about the GME bull thesis, *without considering the short squeeze*. Your thoughts on the bull thesis will dictate how you play it from here on out.

One braindead simple way to calculate a fair stock price for a company is to use a ""times-revenue"" valuation. You take the company's revenue ($6.466B in 2020) and multiply by some magic number (often 0.5 for low-growth companies and 2 for high-growth companies), then divide by the float (number of shares available to trade, 50.65M). A times-revenue multiplier of 0.5 gives a GME stock price of $64, while a multiplier of 2 gives $255.

This isn't a particularly sophisticated method but whatever, I'm not a particularly sophisticated investor.

Working backwards, if Melvin Capital thinks that GME is overpriced at $20 then a times-revenue valuation would suggest a multiplier of 0.16. That's extraordinarily low for a retail business. If you applied that multiplier to Best Buy ($43B revenue in 2020, 231.59M float) you would get a stock price of $30. Best Buy currently trades for $115, which works out to a much more reasonable multiplier of 0.62.

What multiplier is correct? Well, the bulls point out:

* Ryan Cohen (13% stake in GME, sits on the board) has a great e-commerce success story with Chewy, his previous company.
* Three new successful e-commerce board members from Cohen's firm were added to the board in 2020.
* Despite being a brick-and-mortar business and the pandemic, Gamestop's balance sheet isn't bad. They have approx. $550M in debt, but more than that in cash (net cash positive). They have minimal risk of default or bankruptcy in the near future, even without any change to company direction.
* Their traditional core business of game and console sales is not shrinking as fast as many people expected, with major new consoles still supporting optical discs and digital game downloads not accelerating as fast as feared, possibly due to stagnation in the ISP industry. So even if Cohen and his board seats take a long time to roll out new changes, the company is in little danger of any sudden spiral.

So is Melvin right and GME is a dead-end company with no growth potential and should be valued with a times-revenue multiplier vastly below its competitors? Or is it more appropriate to think of it as a brand new business, being spring-boarded off the healthy books of an existing brand by a successful e-commerce businessman alongside a revamped board?

How you judge that determines your exit strategy.

# Exit strategy 1: Just along for the ride

Maybe you don't care at all about GME's balance sheet or Cohen's planned turnaround, you bought a couple shares on a whim to be part of a unique movement. You don't intend to be a long-term Gamestop shareholder nor do you really care if you miss out on the highest peaks, so long as you make a few dollars and get to say you were part of the squeeze.

If I were this person, what would I do? I'd pick a number between 0 and 3 that I feel represents my confidence in the retail market's current expectation for Cohen and GME, and multiply it by 128. I'd submit a limit sell order for all my shares at that share price.

# Exit strategy 2: Pants-shitting fear

You've got a handful of shares and maybe some options and you're up big. You don't know much about squeezes or fundamentals or greeks and every time there's a dip and the stock gets halted you shit your pants and your finger hovers over the sell button. But then the price jumps up and you wipe the drenching sweat off your face and promise to hold firm next time.

If I were this person, what would I do? I'd sell all my options that expire sooner than 30 days at market open to reduce the number of pairs of pants I'm going through. I'd keep all my shares and longer-dated options until the news comes out that the shorts are being liquidated. And I'm not watching hedge fund managers get on Fox Business or CNBC or whatever, I'm following WSB and Twitter for rapid fire updates about short volume. If the short volume as reported by WSB posters drops below, say, 50% I'm selling everything and getting out. I might also pick a maximum times-revenue multiplier (something pretty high, like 4 or 5) and use that for a limit sell for shares.

# Exit strategy 3: Diamond hands

You've got bigger balls than most, and this isn't your first time dumping a significant fraction of your net worth into a company whose financials you've never looked at. You want to ride it to the peak, if at all possible, and you want to impress the pants shitters and the weak-kneed with your maximum gains. You are ok with increasing your cost basis to squeeze out extra tendies on the way to the top.

If I were this person, what would I do? I'd sell my weeklies on open tomorrow and immediately plow every dollar of those 20-bagger returns into shares. If my longer-dated options were purchased at extreme IV I'd do the same for them, otherwise I'd let them ride. I wouldn't sell a single share until the final squeeze, when news comes out that Melvin is done, and then I'd unload (in my pants). See you on the moon, brother.

# Exit strategy 4: u/DeepFuckingValue

IF HE'S STILL IN I'M STILL IN

# FAQ 1: Is it too late to get in?

The best way to judge this is by looking at the exit strategies. Which person are you? If you're (1) then sure, buy a share or two to be part of a once-in-a-decade event, but think of it as a fun expense - a ticket to ride the squeeze train - not an investment. If you're (2) then hell yeah buy those shares baby but avoid options unless there's a dip. If you're (3) or (4) then you're already in and lying to your wife about how deep.

# FAQ 2: Was that the squeeze?! Is it over?

This must get posted every time there's a gamma squeeze. It's midmorning and price suddenly launches into the stratosphere, trading halts, and it crashes back down. No, that wasn't *the* squeeze. Gamma squeezes occur when options prices are rising (due to sudden increased options buying or volatility) faster than market makers can hedge. They're good to get your heart racing but a short squeeze is slower and more stable.

# FAQ 3: How high will it go during the squeeze?

Who knows. $500? $1000? $2000? There's really no way to know. If you have the stones to get those max tendies then you should focus on listening to the emerging news about Melvin Capital and Citadel rather than watching the price. Sell when they're covering and not a moment before. That will be the peak.

# FAQ 4: How long will this take?

Could be tomorrow morning, could be tomorrow afternoon, could be next week. At the rate that shorts are losing money it won't be much longer than that. If you're not in yet, this is the final boarding call.

# FAQ 5: Who will buy our shares at the peak?

The idea behind selling at the peak isn't to sell your shares to another retail trader, but to sell your shares to the desperate short sellers who are forced by their prime brokers to liquidate their positions at any cost. That's the difference between a perfectly legal and time-honored short squeeze and a pump-and-dump. This isn't about irrationally driving the price upwards with the hopes of selling to a bigger idiot, it's about buying and holding and waiting for the shorts to crack and beg us to sell to them.

# FAQ 6: What is the next stock?

Get this thought out of your head. Yeah you just joined WSB and made a few bucks and now you think you found yourself an investment club. **No**. This is a forum for folks to share their risky trade ideas, not a place to coordinate to manipulate the market. Yes, at the moment the consensus is that we can make a boatload of money off of dumbass hedge funds, but think of it less like a pack of draft horses following a path and more like a room of angry, shitting monkeys who happen, for the time being, to be throwing their shit in the same direction.

# FAQ 7: Am I gay?

Many of us grow up to assume that we’re straight only to find out, later, that we’re not. Sometimes, we realize this because we have sex dreams, sexual thoughts, or feelings of intense attraction toward people of the same gender as us. However, none of those things — sex dreams, sexual thoughts, or even feelings of intense attraction — necessarily “prove” your orientation. There are a few different forms of attraction. When it comes to orientation, we usually refer to romantic attraction (who you have strong romantic feelings for and desire a romantic relationship with) and sexual attraction (who you want to engage in sexual activity with). Sometimes we’re romantically and sexually attracted to the same groups of people. Sometimes we’re not. For example, it’s possible to be romantically attracted to men but sexually attracted to men, women, and nonbinary people. This sort of situation is called “mixed orientation” or “cross orientation” — and it’s totally OK. Bear this in mind as you consider your sexual and romantic feelings.

- Stop messaging me asking what you should do. Yes, Melvin Capital has been reported to have covered. You have to decide for yourself whether the squeeze is underway or complete and you should exit or whether you want to hold out for more, or take some profits and hold, or whatever. I just gave you a rough guide and some explanation of different thought processes, you have to make the call for yourself.",2021-01-27 16:09:36

15,Why should any American company ever act responsibly again?,49992,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxw3uz/why_should_any_american_company_ever_act/,2885,"Whats the point of good corporate governance and fiscal responsibility? The companies that leveraged themselves to the moon, did stock buybacks to hyper-inflate their stock price, live on constant debt instead of good balance sheets are now being bailed out by unlimited QE. Free money to cover your mistakes. Why would anyone run a good business ever again? Just cheat and scheme and get bailed out later.

Edit: I am truly honored to be the number 1 post on WSB. To get validation from you autists and retards, the greatest American generation, is the peak moment of my life. Thank you all.

Edit 2: Many of you are saying this post is socialist. It is anti-capitalist. It is anti-wall street. It is none of that. My post is in fact about fixing capitalism so it is done the right way. Don't reward companies that are managed poorly and don't invest their profits wisely. Capitalism is about survival of the fittest and rewarding the winners not the schemers and cheaters. I'd rather have a profitable company that pays its workers livable wages, doesn't use sweat shop labor, doesn't pollute our environment, gives good quality healthcare, paid family leave, sick leave, maternity/paternity leave, reinvests in improving infrastructure, keeps low debt to equity, and has a 12 month emergency fund for a black swan event. Not companies that give all the money to the CEO and Board and nothing to the workers, do stock buy-backs with profits instead of improving infrastructure or saving for emergency funds. Let the greedy poorly run companies fail so we can invest only in good quality companies that treat their workers well. We will all make tons of profits in the market with well run companies and main street America will also be able to live a decent quality life. 

Edit 3: I am not a salty bear. In fact I want the market to do well. But this is not the way. Bailing out weak companies that didn't save for a black swan event because of CEO greed is just making this bubble bigger and bigger and it will only pop worse later on. JPow will ruin our market and the economy with this fake bubble with his printer. Let the market be free so we can shed weak companies and true capitalism can see a rise of the strong companies and the market can moon again.

JPow and his printer are really helping the Wall street elite. Jpow doesn't care about you. Now the tax payers are bailing out shadow banking. Junk bonds are risky loans that private equity, hedge funds, and other shadow banking institutions give out to desperate companies that can't get loans from regular banks anymore. That's why junk bonds are shadow banking instead of traditional banking. JPow is using his unlimited printer to BAILOUT and give free money to the shadiest and greediest characters of wall street and society in general - private equity, hedge fund managers, shady billionaires.

PE, hedgies, shady billionaires were screwed because the economy just halted and companies were going to default on these risky loans since they had no revenue coming in. This is who JPow is helping. He just bailed them all out by buying these risky junk bonds on the back of the American tax payer. You may become homeless and starve, but private equity, hedge fund managers, and shady billionaires will be made whole by the fed.",2020-04-10 04:00:59

Claiming that they're going to go after any collusion. It's all bullshit. Its bullshit from the left and its bullshit from the right. They just want to tear into this issue because it's the classic underdog story and Americans love an underdog story more than anything. 

Right now WSB is like Rocky and every politician out there wants to line up to be in a selfie with Rocky. They're just using us for exposure especially to a crowd that they see as untapped.

Please dont let this place turn into a constant circle jerk of politics. Basically all of reddit is just political propaganda 24/7. This was the last good place on the internet. The LAST. It was the last actually funny place too. Once in awhile it even had incredible ideas.

 It's about to be co-opted by politics activists online claiming they care about ""this issue"". Then they're going to stick around and sometimes subtly and most of the time forcefully turn it into another propaganda machine.
It just makes me sick because I already know its over. I dont want it to be but this place is going to be filled with propaganda and nothing else almost 100% after GME is over. I'll miss you guys and all the great times and sarcasm. This place was the funniest place on the internet.

##Some of these guys traditionally used the media as a tool for them to manipulate the market have failed to further line their pockets and now want to accuse you guys as being manipulators.

##There have been accusations of some inappropriate conduct coming from this community. These are baseless accusations as I have not seen any evidence of this taking place here. You guys know better but I'm going to say it anyway for those who have only recently joined this community that we don't do that stuff here.
  
##People like to talk shit about you when you're a winner, it just comes with the territory.  The way a winner responds is by keeping your head up high and enjoy living rent-free inside the minds of those who doubted you. They'll stare you down as you walk by them with a smile as wide as the sky. You don't even notice them because you're too busy basking in all the glorious tendies you've made.  They hate that you played by the rules and still won.

This is an extension of my DD series on GME. If you haven’t read them and have time, they will provide some background on my previous predictions, some of which have already come true.

# Previous Important Posts

* [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) (DTC Infinity) covered the short positions, the float, and potential snowball impacts of increasing prices, and argued that part of the reason that shorts haven’t closed was that it was pretty much impossible for shorts to close
* [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) covered Cohen, fair market cap analysis, and potential investors, in which I talked about the amazing mid-to-long term potential for GME.
* After the Citron tweet, I shared this [fan fiction on what looked like blatant market manipulation by shorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) on the day of the tweet, and offered some education on strengthening your position. This one got buried and is worth reading.

# What’s happened thus far

## Why did GME go up on Friday?

The story here is more complex than paid media articles would like you to believe. GME has been driven up by 3 different forces:

* Organic buying
   * There is a mixture of growing positive sentiment in the investor world (not just WSB) about GME’s future
   * There’s been a lot of good due diligence shared not just on WSB but even outside (for example, see gmedd.com)
   * The Citron Backfire
      * Shorts were on the ropes and kept looking for hail mary’s. They went to Citron and [coordinated a dump](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) to try to bring the price down.
      * However, this backfired. Citron is so disliked in the industry that new wealth poured into GME in the face of Andrew Left’s pleas. Even when Benzinga brought Andrew Left on air, **minutes after he left** [they bought shares live on their show](https://youtu.be/mFiFWBrE5DE?t=5104)**.**
      * The next day, our very on u/Uberkikz11 [was on Benzinga](https://youtu.be/GLzTU87MJMM?t=837) and more shares were bought.
   * Larger investors piling in
      * In my [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/), I hypothesized that we’d soon see larger investors pile in. Then, on WSB, we saw posts from a [venture capitalist](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/) as well as a [hedge fund investor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/)
* Gamma squeeze
   * Once the organic buying started, we rolled into a gamma squeeze. Many people written about the gamma squeeze so I won’t repeat, see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/) for an example.
* Ultra low liquidity - In EndGame part 1, I talked about how the actual actively traded shares are much lower than the reported float, and **share availability has been reducing** driven by lots of diamond hands, not just among smaller guys like us but the larger folks too.
* I believe there were some short covers on Friday, but Ortex was still estimating 71M shares short at the eod.

However, not many people have talked about why it **went down**

## Why did GME come down?

Here’s where things got interesting for me, and something I think happened again today (Monday) when GME climbed up over 100% but then had a rapid reversal, closing 20% above yesterday but closing below open.

So Friday looked like a slam dunk - gamma squeeze, no shorts available to short, puts were getting exceedingly expensive as a short tactic. What happened?

This is my fan fiction, based on what I saw.

**I believe** [**market-makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) **took a non-neutral stance and began actively shorting the stock after the second halt.**

Market-makers are responsible for maintaining liquidity and functioning in the stock market, but they also have abilities that others don’t - for example they are legally allowed to naked short for “liquidity purposes”. They also have the ability to halt trading.

There were two halts in the day on Friday: First, when GME was up 69% (heh heh), and then a few minutes later when it kept climbing after the first halt was relaxed. Note that at the time of the first halt, the **bid-ask spread was $10 on the underlying** a huge signal that there just were not enough shares to buy.

However, after the second halt, something strange happened. Whereas a few minutes prior, there were no sellers willing to sell their shares below $75, **within 15 minutes** after the halt there were sellers at 70, 65, 60, and 56. Where did these sellers come from?

&#x200B;

[Incredible momentum reversal on Friday 1\/22 to push the price not too far above the 60c strike price. ](https://preview.redd.it/tt5zodp6pkd61.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa22980543213227bf5b3d17166129ac6cb65a65)

My speculation? This was a coordinated **naked short ladder attack**. In this type of attack, short seller A sells to short seller B, who then turns around to short seller A at a lower price, etc. and with a **very small amount of capital** you can wreck the momentum of a stock and make people think that others are running for the exits.

Notice how the stock dropped from a high of $75 on Friday to below 60 - the highest expiring SP for the 1/22 options, and stayed tight in range for the rest of the day. Now, for compliance reasons, MM are required to be neutral by EOD, so 20 minutes before close, MMs had to buy back all their short positions, which led to the strong close above 60.

All this led me to believe that the **real fair market price for GME was above $65.** Without the market makers interference, GME would have closed higher.

## A repeat on Monday

The short ladder attack repeated on Monday.

GME opened strong above $90, and quickly climbed to **a high above $155** before it was halted, immediately after the halt, a **short ladder attack again** drove the price down

&#x200B;

[Dejavu - Incredible Momentum Reversal after trading halts. ](https://preview.redd.it/qm81rd0dpkd61.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b4563e7dd2e626fb09dca69668c24631932e707)

Both days, there **were rapid and significant reversals in momentum.**

Now, I kept wondering - why would MM’s take the side of the shorts? What’s in it for them? One theory was that they were not adequately hedged, with the low liquidity of the stock meaning that the price was moving up too fast for them to acquire the shares they needed to.

But then the news hit today:

# A new opponent enters the ring:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8htb0scgpkd61.png?width=926&format=png&auto=webp&s=228a8a84e592ea4642a61c5e07e07ae344ac8f2c

That’s right, the **same Citadel** [**listed by the NYSE as one of their designated market makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) is now invested in Melvin’s hedge fund and has a financial interest in the direction of GME’s share price.

**Hey media - you want a manipulation story? You’re missing the big one.**

# Now what?

Shorts have pulled new dirty tactics each time they’ve been pushed to the edge. Paid media attacks, Citron’s fluff tweet + coordinated shorting, and now they’ve got the **actual people who get all the order flow on their side.**

On the other hand, GME is still up over 20% and now trading at $88.00 after hours, which is well above the previous day’s high.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rr5qet4ipkd61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=96d28bf446a714906712503726f5903a681d5368

What this tells me is that GME’s **true price is still being suppressed**. They are using every tactic possible, even changing the [bid-ask spread rules](https://thefly.com/permalinks/entry.php/id3233043/GME;IRBT-NYSE-changes-bidask-differentials-on-options-for-GameStop-iRobot) on options to specifically target retail’s buying of options.

We’re now playing the game against the folks who write the rules of the game.

Some shorts may have covered today - with prices below $60 at one point they had some great opportunities to. However, there is **no way all of the shorts who need to exit covered today.**

The short position still lost 20% from yesterday. They’ve got more fingers in the dam, but it’s definitely cracking. Also, **every call option purchased prior to 1/25 is ITM and profitable,** while **every put option purchased prior to 1/25 is OTM.**

And, for some reason, the SEC still doesn’t want to enforce the threshold securities list for GME, where it’s now **been on for more than 30 days in a highly covered “short squeeze”.**

&#x200B;

# Margin impacts:

Note that at this point, most brokers have increased margin on GME. This means that people that are long or short on margin will need to put up capital to hold their positions.

This also means **puts will get more expensive** as people who sell puts will have to maintain 100% of the notional in their accounts to secure the put, so MMs will have fewer retail sellers of puts to absorb the demand.

That means it’s not a bad idea to sell puts to acquire shares if you’re aiming for the long-term and not the squeeze, but keep in mind you’ll need the exact same capital as if you’d bought the shares, so it’s up to you on this.

For shorts, a margin increase while the price is moving against you (even with retracements) is no good.

# My speculation

* Cohen and the GME board have been strangely silent this entire run. It’s possible they can’t say anything at all during the pre-earnings quiet period, but I’m sure they can see what’s happening.
* MMs will continue to play dirty, but at the same time they will need to continue to need to buy GME shares to delta hedge 1/29 and later ITM options as we get closer to expiry.

# Things to be careful about

As you can see, this is no easy win. I've been in GME for a few months but I've seen almost every trick in the book. In addition to the [suggestions I wrote about in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/), here’s some things to be careful about.

* **Be careful about swapping ITM calls for OTM calls:** it can be tempting to trade-up your options for higher return, but be mindful of the delta impact. You may actually be driving the sale of shares by MMs when you don’t mean to. For example, if you sell a .5 delta call for 2 .2 delta calls, that’s net reduction of 10 shares that MMs have to hold long as leverage.
* **Be careful about being short any calls this week:** Not only do you limit your upside (which is dumb in the prospect of a squeeze), you could end up in a nightmare scenario. A call that ends OTM on Friday could end up ITM after hours if you didn’t sell it, and you may get assigned while the underlying continues to go up.
* **There are a few other dirty tactics shorts can play.** I’m not specifically going to share them here because I don’t want to give the ideas circulation, but
   * **Choose your own limit sells based on personal sell points.** Don’t copy others and don’t try to be memey. Make your own decisions.
   * **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it’s an **attack vector** for you.
* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn’t resume for the rest of the day? **All your 1/29 calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you’re taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration.
* **Be careful about buying on margin.** Brokers are rapidly increasing margins. If you bought on margin with 2:1 leverage, and the stock went up 100%, you’d be in margin call even without a margin change. If the broker moves margin against you, you’ll get to margin call faster.
* **Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose.** I’ve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing (remember last Monday with the short sale restriction?), you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I’ve held through multiple 30-40% drawdowns in the underlying; and **held through a 50% drawdown today**, so you need to be ready for the volatility.
* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It’s common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you’ve set a stop loss, be really sure about it.

This is not financial advice; do your own DD. I’m holding over $1M in shares and calls.

# 1/26 Update

Hi everyone. Sorry for not posting or replying to comments. I was auto-banned from WSB when this post was auto-deleted by the auto-mod. Thanks to u/zjz to reversing the auto-deletion of the post though as it looked like it was helpful to the community.  

Hope you all made a ton of money today!

**Quick Notes:**

* At an after-hours price of **$209 a share**, **every call option, for every expiry, for every strike price is in-the-money. This is the third time this has happened for GME recently.** Amazing. What this means now is that market makers will need to buy a lot of shares to hedge for the calls expiring this week. Heed my above warnings. 
* At this price, shorts **will start to get liquidated.** Combining the 400% weekly gain with the margin requirements increasing across the board, brokers will force close short positions. Starting maybe with the small guys, but it will cause a ripple effect. **Things could move fast.** Some funds may get additional bailouts this week to hold out. 
* **You need to decide your own exit.** Only you know how much $ you're playing with, how much you're willing to lose, how important the $ is to you, etc. **Minimize you're regret, don't maximize your profits.** If you are thinking about taking profits this week, spread out your sells so you don't kick yourself over timing things poorly. Personally, I think we are in **unprecedented territory** and that there's no way all of the shorts have exited already, so we're not done. I could be wrong. See EndGame part 1. 
* **Close spreads.** With every call ITM, you are at the risk of early-assignment. If you don't watch closely, you could be hit with sky-high hard-to-borrow fees and get killed on what you thought was a profitable trade. 
* **Watch for ripple effects. This is already happening.** When funds get liquidated, they have to buy back all their other shorts (see AMC, BBBY) and sell their longs (look at BABA after-hours). Want to play GME without playing GME? Maybe throw a little $ at BBBY. You do you. 
* In EndGame Part 2, I talked about potential investors, and how the higher price is gonna attract the bigger $. Today we saw Chamath, Winklevoss, and others. And then Elon tweeted and simultaneously stimulated the buying frenzy and scared the crap out of shorts. I'm just gonna copy what I said about this potentiality
   * ***Elon****: (Least likely, completely improbable, but cataclysmic event). Elon hates shorts. Elon, with TSLA, went through the pain that GME is going through. TSLA almost went bankrupt because shorts were pushing the price down so it was difficult to raise the cash they needed to survive. Sound familiar?* ***Elon’s wealth swings more in a day than GME is worth in entirety.*** *Elon could* ***buy all the fucking float of GME with what he makes in 8 hours****. One call from fellow entrepreneur and* [*aspiring twitter-meme-god*](https://twitter.com/ryancohen) *would absolutely wreck the game.*

1. ***If you are short gamestop****, you are one meme purchase by the richest man in the world away from a fucking cataclysmic event. ""Hey son, I heard you like games. So I bought you gamestop. All of it."" 🚀*

As if we're all so dumb that we don't realize these stocks can go down just like they can go up.  Motherfu\*\*er, have you even been through this subreddit?  We know exactly what the risks are.

This is the sub where people post graphs from March showing themselves 1000X'ing on Puts and then losing it all right back.  We get it more than you do CNBC.  We know there is risk.  Stop acting like you need to hold our hands and protect us.  That's bullshit.  None of you actually care, you're just upset that retail is absolutely killing it while your shitty portfolio is selling off.

What exactly are we risking anyways?  Most people on WSB are young with maybe a few $10K's in the bank.  We are the exact people who should be taking risks.  $10K invested in the stock market even over the next 30 years isn't gonna change your life.  These guys are flying around in private jets telling you to save for retirement so that you won't get kicked out of your shitty apartment at 65 years old.

This is a moment in history where billions of dollars have flowed from the rich to the poor.  Where it'll end up, who knows, but I guarantee that we'd rather play the game and take the loss if it happens than sit on the sidelines and play it safe.  The truth is that if you want to make it in this world, you have to take big ass risks.  The downside is usually overstated.

Millions of people suppressed by the 1% are coming out in droves to fight back. To take back a small, but significant piece of what we’ve help build. We’ve lined the pockets of the greedy corporations, who have exploited the working class. In 1965, CEO employee ratio was 21:1, today it is 320:1 and rising.
This move has provided an opportunity for new and veteran retail traders to regain some of that capital back.

This forum’s open and transparent dialogue has helped people pay off loans, make their rent payments, and perhaps get back on their feet after a horrific and painful 2020. It’s time the world gets to enjoy some tendies. Today, some kid’s $2k to $50k trade can help him regain some footing. Perhaps he can buy something supporting a small business or even start his own. 

This forum has transformed the economic narrative. Short traders pushing to bankrupt businesses at 138% of a company’s value will forever need to reconsider their moves. America was built on the backs of hard working people. Many of these people still work at some of these companies earning minimal pay. Shorts like this puts more people out of work and further into debt further suppressing their ability to make a sustainable living. Billion dollar hedge funds will need think twice about trying to bulldoze America simply for the benefit of a few.

Many of us grew up with some of these companies. Companies like GameStop and AMC are part of
Americana. Sure, you may not have liked the $3 trade in for your game or perhaps you always wondered if the popcorn attendant came in your bucket, but fuck did you not still enjoy the movie experience. Other’s like Nokia and BB helped transform the way we communicate, share and communicate today. Way before we would browse Reddit while shitting, we were playing snake on our 6160. BB was, and still is Canadian. We hated their phones, but love our neighbors. These companies, who have lived among the most shorted companies, finally tells corporate greed that their game stops.

# Gang Life

On your adventure throughout Wallstreetbets you'll notice some retards representing different types of ""gangs"" heres a quick guide to what they stand for.

**Bear Gang / Gay bears / Virgin traders 🌈🐻**

\-*These guys get hard when stocks go down*

*Note: ""gay bear"" in NOT an alternative to calling someone ""retard"". Being called gay bear is 100x worse, true story.*

**Bull Gang / Big Dongus Crew 🐂**

\-*These guys get hard when stocks go up*

**Kang Gang 🦘**

\-*These guys get hard when stocks go way up and then way down*

**Theta Gang θ**

\-*These guys get hard when stocks go sideways*

**Cash gang 💵**

\-*These guys get hard watching other people get hard*

**Late-night gang**

\-*Any retard on wallstreetbets between the hours of 1am pst / 4am est - 4am pst / 7am est*

**West coast gang**

\-*Usually a chad who lives in California or Washington. Heavy presence between 12am pst and 4am pst*

**East coast gang**

\-*Losers that have to wake up at 4 in the morning to look at the pre-market*

**Pajama Traders**

\-*Usually references people who trade futures or those that trade premarket*

**Silver Surfers 🏄**

\-*People that invest in silver commodity*

**Steel Gang**

\-*People that invest in Vale, X or other stocks that go up when steel is in demand*

**Corn Gang**🌽

\-*People that invest in corn*

**Gourd Gang**

\-[*People that invest in Gourd*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzoh1c/i_am_financially_ruined_agricultural_futures/)

**Tanker Gang**🛢️

\-*People that invest in tankers. rip.*

# Surviving as a newcomer

Don't ask retarded questions that are basic such as:

* ""What is an option?""
* ""Should I buy X stock?""
* ""Is it too late?""
* ""What is IV?""
* ""Why can't I trade"" and the market is fucking closed
* ""What are futures?""

All this basic shit will piss off some degenerates because if you don't know any of this there is really no reason for you to be throwing 10k at weeklies you'll lose 99% of the time.

&#x200B;

Not only is it against the rules but nobody gives a fuck about your political thoughts. The only thing we care about on this sub is fucking gay bears and losing money. With this much people in a sub there is bound to be political commentary and I'd advise you to take it to a different sub.

I will update this post if anything else comes to my mind. But to put it succinctly. There is a process I follow. I outlined pretty much everything I do in the series of edits and comments I made in my original gains post here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h83cfp/35k\_590k\_in\_3\_months/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h83cfp/35k_590k_in_3_months/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

If you have any questions in addition though, ask away, I will try to get to everybody. And yes, it fucking feels amazing.

Also, gaymods... can I please get a flair change to ""$35k to $1.25M""?

I'm copying and pasting the tips I had in my other post into this since many of you retarded fucks can't even seem to click a link. The following are the general rules I follow in my trades. They have served me well. Luck has a lot to do with it. Probably 60% or more, but learning to click the damn sell and buy button when you don't feel like it (due to greed or fear) is the second biggest component.

EDIT:

Let me try to answer some of the common questions.

I started with $35k in my ROTH. That was money I saved up from previous job.

Hold 50% cash reserve at all times as a minimum. YOLOs on FDs are not how you build wealth using options.

Go into OTM positions but only about 10-15%, and a reasonable chance that you personal feel the company can get to the strike before expiration

Learn the greeks. Check current IV levels of the company. Try not to get into trades where the IV is at the top tippy top of a 12 month period.

Learn to not beat yourself up over your trades/mistakes/woulda-shoulda-coulda's. <- This right here was the biggest lesson I learned. Staying focused and not killing myself over my huge mistakes. That sense of dread and horror after seeing your account run up to $550k and then plummeting below $100k in a matter of a week or so, I know is horrific, but learn to focus on what you still have left and climb back up.

LET YOUR WINNERS RIDE. If you are cashing out on a hugely green position, consider taking out only a chunk or better yet, put a trailing stop loss around 20%. I put t-stops once a position goes green about 50%. I don't put trailing stops on currently red positions. I exit my losers by hand usually. I think psychologically I prefer to kill the red deals myself because I'd feel even more horrific and blame the system of the broker if I had a losing position exit out on a trailing stop.

Do not put more than 25% of your account into a single position. We celebrate YOLOs and retardism around here yes, but that doesn't mean you need follow the ultra-retards.

Don't hold 20 different positions. I see so many people holding fucking LUV/AAL/UAL/DAL positions at the same fucking time. No, just pick one and focus on it. Doesn't fucking matter which one, currently besides maybe LUV, the airlines move in lockstep.

LEARN TO CUT YOUR LOSSES. Even at -90%. That 10% through the magic of options trading can easily be used to make the 90% again. Try to climb back out of a hole with 0% left though.

I'll edit more in if I think of anything else, but overall, try to stay disciplined. Learning to control (I admit still very ineffectively but enough to usually put a rein on a runaway destructive thought process) my emotions was key. Losses don't kill options traders, calculating your alternate universe net worth on your woulda-coulda-shouldas do.

EDIT 2:

I will say this. My undergraduate degree was in Economics, and I'm finishing up my MBA in Finance right now.

My education I think did give me a great deal of edge, over the average person just plunging into options. That doesn't mean you can't educate yourself. First and foremost go fucking watch some videos on options and their greeks. Implications of volatility on price as well is a basic knowledge you should have.

EDIT 3:

I usually buy contracts 1-2 months out. My plan is to sell around the half way point. Leaving a lot of theta meat on the bone so that they are still more valuable.

10-15% OTM. I never buy ITM. That 10-15% level has worked for me. I go for a strike price that I personally feel the stock can hit within the expiration. Almost all my winning trades have been ITM by the time I sold I believe.

EDIT 4:

If you look at my history, I followed the trends down, and then the trends up. If there's one ""strategy"" to what I do, you can say I ride trends. Knowing the trend was more instinctive. When China, the second biggest fucking economy in the world, was willing to take an extreme measure of forced quarantine of almost 500 million of its citizens, I understood just how fucking serious the virus was. Was that getting priced in the US stock market though? The potentially similar lockdowns in the US? No. Market was fucking hitting ATH at the same time. I shorted the shit out of everything about a week after (including DIS, $80p I bought when it was at $130) market hit ATH I think. My instinct was right, I went up to $550k\~ or so from this.

But then I made the mistake of holding when the trend had reversed. The market was no longer responding to the bad news. More death count than any other source of death in the country per day? Green. Record setting unemployment? Green. I went from $550k down to $91k. Bought ballsdeep calls from here and rode the wave back up.

Learning to get a sense of the current trend is the hardest part I think. And who is your best friend? The trend. Who gives you your giant pile of tendies? The trend. Who buys your wife a new iMac pro? The trend. Never try to ""outsmart"" the market. You're going to lose you fucking shirt.

EDIT 6:

Almost forgot one of the biggest lessons I learned. I never ever close a position within the first \~1 hour of market opening. I usually close them in the last hour instead. Contract pricing is usually way out of wack across the board you are going to have massive amounts of slippage, mispricing, and just retarded level of lag and shit, even on the big boy brokers like Fidelity. (The only exclusion here would be for SPY...I don't go into SPY anymore, but if I did, I will sell at market open. The liquidity and the price movement is already built in when market opens for SPY. Any other tickers like AMZN, this rule applies)

EDIT 7:

I will add one more thing that led to my biggest gain trades. When a stock currently is at ATH, I mean actual ATH not high of 52 weeks, then there's a massive momentum going for the stock and chances are it will keep that momentum for a while. Using this logic, I went into AMZN calls. Many people asked me why I got in when it had already run up from $1.9k to like $2.1k or something, it's because I used that logic. (Be aware of buying into meme stocks ATH though, I'd be ready to cut my losses the next day if I got into a meme stock and it didn't continue going up/down)

EDIT 8:

Let me make one point clear. You are nothing. You are a nobody. Nobody gives  a fuck about your gut feeling, or TA voodoo, or this, and that, and the market doesn't owe you shit. You are a dumbass. You are a dumbass. Repeat after me, you are a dumbass. The sooner you get this fact through your thick skull and learn to respect the trends of the market, the better it will be for your trades. Learn humility, stop fucking bragging about your 1 or even 10 wins, and more importantly, don't delude yourself into thinking you figured out the secret after your few trades. You haven't. Learn to be humble, and always fucking respect the market trends. It may feel like it, but this is not a fucking game, unless you want it to be and think the #'s you see on the neo screen are not real. You are trying to make serious $, not be proven right or how smart you are. I'll repeat, take ego out of it. Or not. But for me to get to this level over about 350 trades, these tips I outlined above worked remarkably well.

EDIT 9:

Many people seem to miss my points from the above giant ass retarded fucking post. So let me write another paragraph you can ignore. Hopping on the same trend is not enough. People pull out too soon, or worse they insist on going the wrong fucking direction. Even with my gains, I pulled out early on so so sooo many trades, with lost gains to the tune of approximately $3\~ mil by my rough estimate. Letting my winners run and not pulling out too quickly let me get some big wins. This was not something easy for me to do, I was always tempted to pull the plug early on my positions but I held most and relied on tight trailing stop losses.",2020-07-09 03:19:31

From [Bloomberg:](https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2019-07-19/cohen-cub-gabriel-plotkin-sees-fund-surge-about-44-this-year)

Plotkin described Melvin as “a very human-intensive place. We have a lot of analysts, we require a lot out of them.” The team has modeled more than 500 companies in “significant detail,” while a data science group reads into trends.
He added that the firm has an “intense focus” on the short side, with about 70% of profits in Melvin’s first year coming from bearish bets. Plotkin expressed skepticism about mall real estate investment trusts, as well as electric-car maker Tesla Inc.

**BULLSHIT.** Regulation for what? Exchange of ideas? Our own Due Diligence? Winning against you in your own game? Yeah, in most cases your buddies at the SEC would gladly do so if you tell them anyway. This time though? People finally came to the realisation what the fuck you guys are doing over there. It was known by many since 2008 but people forgot quickly, and now is the time to remind them that you are no one else's friend but your crooked buddies.

I never thought I'd say this, but this community showed more leadership and guidance than any other media network. Providing knowledge, research, answers, many of you proven that **you are better people** than these fuckers with billions of dollars of AUM. You should be proud of yourselves as you are leading an unprecedented event in the history of finance. **Unprecedented.** This is why you should still guide others and be an example. Of course, we are not an entity and we will never be - just remember that you are a part of something great, maybe something that will change the way financial world operates, in a smaller or larger way. Remember that there are sharks among us who got pissed at the dirty games as well (shoutout to you Elon & Chamath). We are not alone.

They blame us? Let's blame them. They will lose all credibility sooner than later, not to mention this incoming generation. The media is here now, you still might convince my 80-year old grandpa that the internet is something out of Pandora's Box, but soon enough you won't be able to convince a single person. We are an important source of information for many people, and I'm not talking about WSB, but about the people that make it. Let's go there in the world and spread the facts.

This is a big moment. A tug of war between tradition and the future.

Hedge fund managers live in the past, and continue to look down upon the retail investors. They truly believe that we, the average retail investors, don't know anything about finances or the market (which may be true), and we're just gambling our money away.

We don't know any better. WE NEED HEDGE FUND MANAGERS TO TELL US WHAT TO DO! SAVE US!

This is the world they want to live in. This was the past.

Remember that scene from the Sopranos, where Tony's wife calls to buy 5000 shares of Webonics, after she was manipulated emotionally to so?  Institutions and hedge funds want us to be stuck in that world.

They're scared of the future.

They're scared because, so much information is available for free now. THere's no more fees for trading. We have large communities that discuss stocks and trading openly.

We can think and make decisions for ourselves, which scares the FUCK out of old school institutions and hedge funds.

Fuck them all. This affects every single one of you, whether or not you're holding $GME.

TLDR: Fuck hedge funds. This is a crosspoint into the future.

52,People will try to gaslight you into believing that playing $GME is wrong or something to be ashamed of. But keep the following in mind...,23828,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6eqqu/people_will_try_to_gaslight_you_into_believing/,988,"Inevitably, there will be a smear campaign led by certain organizations and media members against retail traders who are getting in on $GME. One argument that will be made is that it's not fair that we made so much money by recognizing that a group of hedge funds and institutions were in over their heads. It hurts the market and we should feel bad for exploiting them.

The total market cap of $GME is around $12B as I'm writing this. **The total market cap of Wall Street is around $50T.** That means we've currently displaced about .025% of the total value of the US stock market. I will type that out to reiterate: we (retail traders) have displaced approximately one quarter of one tenth of one percent of the total market cap. To claim that we are doing anything which is tremendously harmful to the whole market is absolutely pants-on-fire lies. Is this going to change some elements of the market moving into the future? Almost certainly. But even if this stock goes to $1000 per share, we are still only talking about less than one tenth of one percent of the total market cap that's out there. 

If you're looking at your RH balance right now  and thinking ""wow, that's a lot of money, am I doing something wrong? Illegal, even?"" the answer is **ABSOLUTELY NOT.** What you are beginning to notice is that the wealth gap in this country is absolutely massive. Thousands upon thousands of people could make year changing or life changing money out of this squeeze and it'll hardly be a blip on Wall Street's radar. Greed is absolutely out of control at the top and this funny little news story is tangible proof of that. Do not let them gaslight you into thinking that it's wrong for you to get a slightly larger sliver of the pie. 

Good luck to everyone playing this. I've got 100 shares at a cost basis of $103.95. I might not make millions, but I might be able to make a dent in my student loans, or pay off my car, or something that makes me just a little more hopeful that I'll be able to live some sort of ""American Dream"" before I'm old and wrinkled.

edit: and in the event that you're literally brand new to trading (we're getting a lot of new people here), I would highly encourage you to read up on investment basics (there are literally millions of resources on this) and do some research into $GME and why it's moving the way it is. I would not recommend taking a position on any stock if you can't articulate your own reason as to why you're invested in it.",2021-01-28 08:25:53

They call us names and make it seem like we are bandits, when in reality we are your brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles and so on. There is nothing malicious about liking a stock and buying and holding it. 

In fact, CNBC and other outlets encouraged the young generation to start investing and tell us the stock market is the greatest creation of wealth possible. 

But when we do, they don’t like us getting it right. They are the pool sharks at the table and they just want us to play to get our money.

Melvin and Citadel manipulated and organized a fake crash today on low volume and are likely out of their old most dangerous short positions,20848,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l74q3s/important_melvin_and_citadel_manipulated_and/,1197,"Disclaimer: **I'm still long GME** 💎🙌🏻 🚀🚀🚀

**This is potentially a market manipulation conspiracy of the highest order, here is what potentially happened today with the crash:**

**1)** Citadel conspires with Brokers (Who are dependant on citadel securities for their business) to **BAN the buying of GME stock**, but continue to **allow only selling** 

**2)** Hedge funds or Citadel use high frequency trading algorithms to **artificially create downwards pressure on the stock price** through increasingly lower bids (Faked market movement transactions between two parties to themselves or an intermediary) - 

❗❗❗**This strategy is only possible due to low volume, and low volume is created because INVESTORS LITERALLY CANT BUY THE STOCK BECAUSE BROKERS BANNED BUYING IT**❗❗❗

**3)** **Most Retail investors are unable to buy the now highly discounted shares during the crash**, they are only able to sell or buy in when the crash is already over and shorts covered. People see that the stock price went from 450$ to 150$ and a mass selloff panic makes a bunch of people sell their stock. Frequent halts only allow for 10-15s of selling on the way down increasing panic.

**4)** **SINCE RETAIL INVESTORS CANT BUY ANY GME STOCK, WHO BUYS ALL THESE PANIC SOLD GME SHARES? FUCKING HEDGE FUNDS THATS WHO**, every stock sold during the drop and at the bottom is not bought by normal investors, its bought by hedge funds to cover their shorts

**5)** Hedge funds cover their shorts on the way to the bottom at 120$ closing their positions at a lower loss. 

**6)** Now they buy call options and stop manipulating the stock price downwards, natural market forces create a bounce making their calls worth more -> they sell these calls immediately to recoup further losses made on their shorts

**7)** Hedge funds successfully exited their positions at a  much lower loss at the bottom of the crash or highly reduced their losses. 

**8)** If they're ever bigger greedy fucks **Hedge funds can now RE-BORROW shares at fucking dirt-cheap prices** now that they've neutrally closed their heavily in the red positions and repeat the same thing again, or just not get back in the game

-------------------------

**SOME BIG PLAYERS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY BEHIND THIS MARKET MANIPULATION ARE MOST LIKELY OUT OF THEIR MOST DANGEROUS NAKED SHORTS, THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT SHORT % HAS DECREASED THOUGH, IT COULD BE REPLACED BY NEW SHORTS FROM OTHER HEDGE FUNDS ETC. .**

The one holding the bag in the end wont be Melvin or Citadel, it'll be random retail investors and smaller funds.

❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗**OKAY AGAIN FOR THE RETARDS IN THE BACK** ❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗

**Q:WHY TOTAL SHORTS ARE STILL OVER 100%, BUT SOME BIG PLAYERS PROBABLY ALREADY COVERED**

**THERE ->IS NOT<- ONLY 1 PERSON/FUND/INSTITUTION SHORTING 100%+ OF THE STOCK. ITS HUNDREDS OF HEDGE FUNDS AND INVESTORS AND INSTITUTIONS. THE SHORTS COULD DECREASE BY 5% AND THATS ENOUGH FOR A BIG EXIT FOR SOME PLAYERS, LIKEWISE 10% OF OLD SHORTS COULD EXIT, AND 20% NEW SHORTS WOULD ENTER AND SHORT AND THE SHORTED FLOAT WOULD GO UP 10% WHILE STILL ALLOWING OLD SHORTS TO EXIT THEIR POSITIONS, SHORT FLOAT STAYING THE SAME OR INCREASING DOESNT MEAN THAT SOME HEDGE FUNDS DIDNT CLOSE THEIR OLD EXTREMELY RISKY POSITIONS**

**IM NOT SAYING THAT THE ENTIRE SHORT POSITION ON GAMESTOCK IS CLOSED. ITS NOT, IT'S STILL OVER 100% I'M JUST SAYING THAT A FEW SPECIFIC !BIG! PLAYERS WHO WERE SHORT MOST LIKELY EXITED THEIR MOST RISKY SHORT POSITIONS BY POTENTIALLY ARTIFICIALLY CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR A CRASH**

**IF A FEW HEDGE FUNDS SHORTED A FEW SMALL % OF THE TOTAL FLOAT AND COVERED AT THE BOTTOM OF TODAYS CRASH THE TOTAL FLOAT SHORTED WOULDN'T CHANGE MUCH BUT A FEW KEY PLAYERS COULD BE OUT OF THEIR POSITIONS, LIKEWISE NEW SHORTS COULD BE REPLACING OLDER ONES WITH CHEAPER SHORTS**

-------------------------

Edit1:

**FURTHER ASK YOURSELF:**

**IF CITADEL AFFILIATED STOCK BROKERS WERE REALLY PROTECTING RETAIL INVESTORS DUE TO ""RISK"" WHY DIDNT THEY BAN BUYING AND SELLING?** 

**THEY BANNED BUYING ONLY, HELPING THEIR HEDGE FUND BUDDIES DRIVE THE PRICE DOWN TO COVER SHORTS**

**AND ONLY RETAIL INVESTORS WERE BANNED FROM BUYING, HEDGE FUNDS COULD STILL BUY NORMALY**

**MEANING THAT THE HEDGE FUNDS HAD FIRST PICK ACCESS TO BUY THE SHARES TO COVER THEIR SHORTS, THESE SAME SHARES WOULD NORMALLY BE BOUGHT BY RETAIL INVESTORS MAKING IT MORE EXPENSIVE FOR SHORTS TO COVER**

__________________________________________________________

Edit2:

**SHORTED STOCK % MIGHT NOT CHANGE MUCH DUE TO EITHER NEW SHORTS BUYING IN, OR OLD SHORTS NOW SHORTING IN A MUCH CHEAPER WAY - NOW THAT THEY GOT RID OF THEIR MOST DANGEROUS SHORT POSITIONS**

**ALL SHORTS MIGHT NOT BE CLOSED, BUT THIS MARKET MOVE WAS ARTIFICIALLY CREATED TO COVER AT MINIMUM THE MOST OVER-LEVERAGED AND RISKY SHORT POSITIONS THESE FUNDS TOOK ON THEMSELVES**

___________________________________________________________

EDIT3:

**THE PRICE CRASHED ALMOST 400$ ON LIKE 10%-20%  OF THE USUAL TRADING VOLUME, DOES THIS LOOK LIKE ""NATURAL"" MARKET BEHAVIOUR TO YOU?**

**IF THIS WAS A NATURAL STOCK CRASH THE VOLUME WOULD BE RELATIVELY HIGH, BUT INSTEAD THE STOCK PRICE DROPPED 70-80% ON 1/10TH OF USUAL TRADING VOLUME. THAT IS ALMOST A GUARANTEED SMOKING GUN THAT THE PRICE HAD BEEN ARTIFICIALLY MANIPULATED**

EDIT 4:

Ask yourself why the market dipped yesterday despite fantastic earnings reports coming out

Answer: Funds were liquidating their other stock market positions to be able to close our their shorts with this market attack today

Why did the markets rally today during the GME crash?

Because the funds re-bought into their old positions in various companies now that they've closed their shorts and no longer at risk of bankruptcy and have additional capital available

After just a few hours of studying the forum, bankrupted Cedar Hill’s algo learned to spend literally every dollar the fund had, plus margin and an advance on the company credit card, on 0DTE 9/11 $45 NKLA calls which expired worthless several hours later.”

Observers were quick to point out that Cedar Hill’s algorithm had done exactly what it was designed to do in modeling the behavior of a r/wallstreetbets user. Before being discontinued, the algo also posted a screenshot of its billions in losses to the forum and spent the next day suggesting that other users’ wives had boyfriends.

71,I used to work @ Merrill. Here's what likely happened today with Robinhood and what it means for short-squeezing investors,18578,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7fw0x/i_used_to_work_merrill_heres_what_likely_happened/,2159,"I just wanted to throw this out there in the middle of the outrage, in the hopes that someone can take it in and strategize, rather than be upset. Worked @ Merrill as an analyst from 2014-2016.

I also like to keep it concise so follow along. This ain't a fucking Qanon fan fiction.

Disclaimer: I own GME. This is not financial advice. This is just some dude chatting with his old buddies.

---------------------------------------------------------
1) **Robinhood, restrictions, suppression**: 

When you place an order through RH, Citadel or some other HFT front runs your trade and pockets the spread; However, the transaction is not complete.

Enter: Clearing house. The clearing house is the intermediary between the counter-parties. Because they stand between sellers & buyers, they have very defined levels of risk, risk management and regulation to be in front of.  The clearing house is who gives you the ""title"" for your shares, the folks who make it official.

**What Likely Happened**: The risk department retard @ the clearing house, who does jack shit all year other than flag Stacy's trade so he can get some face time with her runs to the C-Suite frazzled; He has looked at option open interest expiring this week, has done the math and there simply isn't enough float for GME in anyway, shape or form; turns out WSB is printing out their stock certificates and burying them in the Mojave Desert. It's simply not enough.

In addition, they got a Snapchat from SEC/OCC which said hey, if you fucking keep selling open positions, you're on your own; we ain't gonna help you. SEC is sneaky like that; they like sending messages through the backdoor, not the front because they used to be hedgies themselves. If you're not following, Front door is making a public statement while the backdoor is a threat sent to an intermediary who you and millions of investors don't even know exists.

So, they call up the risk department at RH and tell em to stop fucking selling GME, there simply isn't enough float, the SEC told the clearing house they're on their own and who tf is gonna take the blame/liability if there's a ""failure to deliver""? 

---------------------------

2) **Failure to Deliver**:

This is a pretty fucking big deal. Bigger than you imagine, because it's basically a slam-dunk law suit. 

Failure to deliver means that one of the counterparties (in this case, the firm who sold you the option, RH or the clearing house) has failed to deliver you a contractually obligated position, profit or certificate. Since there's no float and ITM calls get exercised by HFT bots at the end of the day, how in the fucking hell are they gonna deliver the option holders their contractually obligated merchandise if there is no merchandise to be delivered? There simply isn't enough for everyone. Thousands (or possibly hundreds of thousands) of failures to deliver =  big risk


---------------------------

3) **Liability**: 

You must be asking so what? Fuck them; They should be the ones figuring it out and they gotta give me, the customer, the right to choose or whatever the fuck; That sounds great in a boomer fashion but it's not that simple. Robinhood is contractually obligated to deliver you those shares or positions. If they fail to, they become liable for any losses or profits that you may have endured and they will LOSE in court cause they FAILED to DELIVER. How many people have options on GME on RH? Half? Imagine if half of these fine RH customers were legally owed benefits and they were engaged in DDoS style lawsuits involving Robinhood or the clearing house. There would be no Robinhood left. There would likely be no clearing house left. Robinhood is also a shitshow of a company, so they likely didn't even have additional collateral to put up to the clearing house for normal share buying and selling on the meme tickers and since they bank with T-Mobile, they had to pull the plug.

Hence: Bad Decision > Bankruptcy or worse (WSB finds Vlad's mom and becomes her boyfriend collectively)


I personally don't believe it was out of malice or a coordination for RH; there's definitely coordination all around, but occam's razor says this is not such an ordeal.

---------------------------


Couple of semi-related notes:

-Fuck Billionaires. Parasites of modern society, simply existing to leech off every slurp of alpha and take up resources meant for billions of poor people. **** them in the streets, ***** them in the **** , **** them from skyscrapers. Whatever is needed to discourage hoarding of resources of this tiny fucking planet.

-I very much doubt that Ken Griffin and Citadel (the HF) would engage in blatant market manipulation or coercion of Robinhood or other brokers to make a few bucks on Gamestop or AMC. They cleared over 6 billion net last year, so just logically, it seems pretty unlikely to risk it for this. It is also very unlikely that Citadel Securities would engage in illegal behavior for the profit of Citadel, simply because it's such a money maker. If you were an evil genius, would you let your money maker go to shit because you were getting squeezed on some short?

-The media just wants clicks and engagement, so they will bring the worst people on, simply to pad their own bottom line. Don't get engaged. Don't give in to them. Be the captain of your own ship and fuck over wall-street however you please.

-The restrictions on the others tickers is likely proactive, not reactive. 

- **TL;DR**: There's simply not enough float and the broker/clearing house will fail to deliver on a large scale if they keep letting new positions be opened, hence restrictions.

- **What will happen now**: Based on my previous short squeezes, Friday (tomorrow) will be nuts; All this gamma has to go somewhere and since there's not enough float, I'm guessing up up up up up.",2021-01-29 12:57:42

84,The biggest risk we face (and why it's nothing to worry about for now),16717,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6n4ay/the_biggest_risk_we_face_and_why_its_nothing_to/,1228,"Greetings all. Bit of background: I've been on this sub for years (was even a mod temporarily when /u/only1parkjisung modded a bunch of people for fun long, long ago), and I've been in the hedge fund world for about a decade (I'm a sell-side analyst; won't go into more detail than that as it isn't necessary). I mention all of this because I know both how this world works and how the hedge fund world works, which gives me a unique insight into what might happen next.

I won't make any predictions on GME, BB, or other stocks, because I don't think the squeeze's biggest risk right now is there. Rather, the biggest risk comes from what we've already seen happen over at Discord with the shutdown of the server. Note that Discord has had significant investment from private equity funds including FirstMark Capital, Greenoaks Capital Partners, Index Ventures, IVP, Greylock Partners, Benchmark, Accel, General Catalyst, Ridge Ventures, Spark Capital, and Tencent Holdings. At least one of these firms has invested with Point72 Ventures, which recently helped Melvin Capital. So it's not too surprising that strings were pulled to get the Discord channel banned for ""hate speech"" (which is a very useful brush to tar anyone with, as anyone who challenges it can easily be dismissed as a nazi).

Now, this subreddit's long history of using several slurs is an opportunity for the hedge fund world to claim it is a hate subreddit and pressure Reddit to get it closed. I recommend the r-word and f-word be banned by mods for this reason; yes I know it is stupid and, well, r-worded, but best to play the game and self censor rather than give these assholes a single in to destroy this community.

What is the risk of Reddit getting orders from owners to shut us down? At the moment, I'd say pretty low, but the bigger it gets the more there is that risk. Reddit is owned by Advance Publications, which is owned by Donald Newhouse and the Newhouse family (some details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Newhouse). Fortunately, Newhouse's family office (think a private hedge fund dedicated to investing just the family's money) is pretty far removed from the hedge fund world afaik. The family office's CIO (details here: https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1g6j2tztzpb3t/A-New-CIO-for-One-of-America-s-Richest-Families) got her career started in the investment bank world and did not work for hedge funds, at least according to her Linkedin profile. So the Donaldson family has limited motive to stick their necks out and force a ban of this subreddit.

However, it remains a risk and a very serious one. I suggest the mods work together to get some legal representation going; if Palihapitiya was serious about investing in the WSB community, I'd suggest putting some money aside for this and for compliance. A kickstarter fund would not be a good idea because of the ease with which bad faith arguments of collusion could be made.

In short, WSB is at the mercy of Reddit's admins, who are at the mercy of its executives, who are at the mercy of the owners. While WSB is making serious progress as a revolution against the billionaires, this is a very serious weakness that the Discord ban has exposed and that mods need to work on fixing asap.",2021-01-28 14:44:13

I started this as a hobby of sorts. Just to make some extra cash and maybe have a little fun. I've done okay these past 2 months and bragged the other day about how I was becoming somewhat of a ""stock broker"", like the ones on Wall Street. There was a glint of awe and admiration in her eyes, a shine I hadn't seen in years.

Today I lost everything and I don't want to go home. Part of me wonders if they're better off without me. 

So I'm here asking for advice as someone who only a couple months ago stumbled on to your world. How do you deal with the loss and disappointment? How do you face your loved ones when they ask how things are going? In my case, my loss directly affects them because its $28 I could have used for groceries or something to benefit them.

On the eve of this great day, I think it's important to say that it's always best to understate/undersell your winnings to friends and family. I, for instance, will only tell when asked, and then give a figure around 50/60% of the real figure.


**There are a multitude of reasons for doing this:**

1. People do not understand the hard work and risk you have taken for these gains, and so will expect them for free

2. Manipulative people will come out of the woodwork

3. You may have taxes yet to pay (I know it sucks)

4. You may lose all of this money yet (I am taking an investing break after this insane ride) 

5. The money is not a running tap, and is lump sums, so don't build a lifestyle around it 

6. Money is so much easier to spend than to make, please be sensible

That's all I have to say. Have a quiet cigar or champagne when you do cash out (above $1000 of course), or come up with some other excuse as to where the money came from.

BOYS AND GIRLS LISTEN UP, TODAY IS A BIG DAY

Infinity War has gone global. Our retarded brothers and sisters from across the world are getting news about the war and filling our ranks

Quick update: 

*ALLIES* 

**Dr. Michael McFlurry Burry:** Actually autistic. DO NOT TOUCH HIS EARS 

**Supreme Leader General Cohen:** Loves peanuts, dogs, and hamsters. A human golden retriever. The people’s General. 

**Sir Chamath Brown Knight Palihapitiya:** Good with numbers. Math is literally in his name. Our voice. Hates parasitic billionaire hedge funds. Enjoys passively swinging his giant balls on Twitter. Our Brown Knight. 

**u/deepfuckingvalue:** Likely to become the worlds first trillionaire after Infinity War. Enjoys Seinfeld. Possibly a virgin. The original retard. 

**Lord Chen of BB:** Nimble. Very hard to understand... on purpose. Told securities commission he had no idea why his stock was going up, later that day releases PR of Baidu partnership. “OH so Sorry SEC, me no speakaaaaaa any Engrish” 

**Papa Musk:** Wields the sword of a thousand truths. Legendary short destroyer and bear meat connoisseur. Lucky numbers are 420 and 69. Actually has rockets. Our Papa. 

**r/wsb:** Actual retards. 

*AXIS OF EVIL:*

**Melvin Capital:** If Voldemort ran the Chum Bucket, you’d get Melvin Capital. A parasitic leech. Would sell their own mothers for a dime. Pure scum. 

**Andrew Left:** A tremendously gay bear. Wild, and unpredictable. Strong initial attacker, but very low HP. Folds like a house of cards once you make yourself bigger and yell loud noises

**CNBC Boomers:** The mouthpiece of the Axis of Evil. A dying platform. Extremely jealous of our tendies. It was once said: thou shalt not covet thy neighbors wife’s boyfriend, CNBC did not listen. They want everything from us—mainly our voice and presence. 

**Retail Bears:** Backstabbing unconscionable fucks. No morals, no backbone. Fucking Judas. 

**Unknown financiers:** The roots are deep in this conglomerate of evil. Final bosses might show up in the coming battles. 

**SEC:** Did not go after anyone for 2008 when the entire world almost collapsed. Now thinks GME stock price too high in their opinion. 

*BYSTANDERS:*

**Jim Cramer:** A real life Ephialtes. Looks like him too. Genuinely wants to be a Spartan, but in the end will sell our stops to Melvin Capital so they can attack our position from the rear. 

Pro tip: NO STOP LOSSES ON A VOLATILE SHORT SQUEEZE

**Retards on the sidelines:** We are witnessing one of the greatest reverse wealth transfers in history. Get in and be a part of history. 

*CASUALTIES:*

**Toilet Paper Handed Soldiers:** WHEN YOU BOUGHT GME AT $150 and it went to $80 WE TOLD YOU WE’D COME BACK FOR YOU. No retard left behind. Band of retards. Apes stronger together. I know you are wounded, but the war is not over. 

*FRONTS:*

$GME is the main battle front. There are others. But GME is THE BATTLE FRONT. 

Listen retards, we have literal whales on our side. General Cohen, Papa Musk, Sir Chamath, Dr. Michael McFlurry Burry. We have politicians on our side, AOC, Elizabeth Warren. Possibly the fucking president of the U S and A.

Mine is a common NYC story.   I went to Yale and Stanford, coming from working class roots out of nowhere.  I didn't have a plan for after college, so I did NYC banking work like everyone similar at the time (it was a few years before everyone decided they should go to DotCom companies).  The  ""I don't have a plan"" on campus interview train of my day usually led to ""easy"" money doing bank work in Manhattan.  I'm older than nearly everyone on this sub.  I did the 100 hour weeks (before blackberrys and iphones existed en masse, so you had to actually sit at your fucking desk all night).  I made some money, but not master of the universe money.   Enough to be comfortable, even in NYC (it was cheaper in the 90s).  You could have seen me at Anna's in the Financial District in the late 90s.  It's a Dos Toros now.

I stuck with it.  Went to grad school and back. I moved uptown and into private equity buyout work, at a well known shop in midtown.  You could have found me in the 2000s with one of those (in retrospect) stupid looking Hermes ""H"" belts we all had those days (tie to match).   By this time I'd lost my drinking pretense.  I'd get drunk at a hole called Jimmy's corner.  Just tried to get through the day.  Hated every minute of it.  But I was decent at the jobs and got many promotions.

I got carry on the right deal, and I moved out of PE the second I got paid.  I'm in a completely second career now by choice, and I have never looked back.  I left a lot on the table, but I fucking hated working those deals.  Soul crushing.   Buy a company, fire people and make short term decisions that will bite company in ass 10 years down the road, sell company in 5 years.  Rinse repeat.

I've seen a lot of shit.  I've been with our advisors at Lazard trying to bullshit our way through 12 week cashflow statement to save a shitty company and get a rescue package at 2am.  I've been in a Wachtell conference room at 3am hammering final points to sign before an 830am pre-market takeover announcement.   I nearly tripped over the Blackstone 3 story sky lobby stairs at one point.    I went to closing dinners at every place that was cool 20 years ago but are probably sad or closed now (BTW:  you kids should lobby to bring back closing dinners; they went away in 07 but are fucking awesome).   I'd put my bona fides up against anyone (almost anyone?) here.

&#x200B;

***Most importantly, I've seen a lot of shifty, disingenuous bullshit.  But major brokerages closing trading today was probably the worst thing I ever saw.    It's a terrible investment and I'm going to lose money, but I threw some $$$ down to protest.  Fuck those guys.***

96,Explanation for noobs who don't quite understand what's going on...,15276,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6kgik/explanation_for_noobs_who_dont_quite_understand/,1451,"Mods: does DD tag apply? If not change it.

I wrote this in response to someone elsewhere who asked simply:

> So they're betting against the company? Like, they have no faith in them? Investing like this makes one feel horrible.

Yeah. There are three ways you can short.

--- 

1) You buy an option with a predetermined end date with the RIGHT to sell a stock at a certain price (depending on how much you want to pay determines the price.) If a stock is $10 and you expect it to drop to $5 in 6 months, you might buy a $9, 10 month expiry ""put"" (right to sell at price) option. This might cost you 50c per share. 

IF you're even slightly right, ie it drops to any price lower than $8.49 before expiry you made 1c per share. You can also change your mind and sell the option (either more (profit) or less (loss) than 50c/share).

IF you're properly right, and it does drop to exactly $5 you make $3.5 per share. If it rises, or drops to any number above $8.50, you lose the price of the option (50c/share). 

---

2) You're a big player. You call your buddies at Pension Fund X42 and say ""Hey can I borrow those shares you have for x% interest and return them to you later?"" A set timeframe may be set. I don't know for sure, but probably. Anyhow, Pension Fund X42 says ""ok"" because they aren't looking to sell them, so might as well make some interest on lending them. 

So you borrow them, and immediately sell them. You pay your daily interest to the pension fund, and you wait. When the price drops, and you decide that you've made enough, you buy them back and return them. You keep the difference in prices whatever that may be, minus the interest.

If you're wrong... You're still obliged to return the shares to Pension Fund X42. So at some point you have to decide to eat a loss and buy the shares back. 

---

3) You're a big player and you are ok with a bit of lawbreaking, you Naked Short Sell. This is great because it's cheaper! No interest payments! 

Here, you simply sell shares you don't have, and buy the imaginary shares you just created back later so that the number of shares on issue doesn't get too far out of whack and you don't get investigated. Any gap between your sell price and buy price is profit or loss depending on which way it goes. 

---

What's happened right now is mostly a combination of 2 and 3. I'm sure there is a bit of 1, but 1 only causes predictable losses (Like the cost of playing a hand at a casino. You only lose the amount you bet if the cards don't go your way.)

So the risk with 2 and 3 is that because you're **obliged** to buy back the shares at some point, if they go up, when you have to quit, you have to pay the current market price and your actions can make the price go up even more. 

Now you're in a short squeeze. You are obliged to buy but the price keeps going up every time you do. It's entirely possible that others see the price going up and buy, so you're now competing to buy a limited number of shares with everyone else. So the price goes higher. Your losses are potentially infinite. 

---

**What's slightly different** between this particular short squeeze and all the others is:

---

1) The dumb fucks naked short sold AT LEAST 40% more shares than ever existed. They're obliged to buy back more shares than is possible. The only way out of that self-made trap is a complicated mess of desperately buying, returning, rebuying from the people you borrowed them from, and returning them with losses at every step. Imagine if I sold you 10 cars, but only delivered 6. You're standing there with your wtf face and I say ""Hey! how much would you sell those 4 cars for?"" You can name your price at this point. I pay it. Then I ""finish"" my ""10 car delivery.""

---

2) Retail traders are acting as one single semi-coordinated hive, loosely behaving similarly to what would in prior short squeezes, be a competitor hedge fund. They own a lot of the shares the hedge funds (HFs) NEED to buy - but they're not selling. They're actively cheering for the HFs bankruptcy while watching the price of the stock they hold skyrocket. Only other HF billionaires are allowed to do that and get away with it. 

.

2a) HFs can be negotiated with. If you're really, really getting bent over and fucked, and you grovel enough, you can usually cut a deal where they stop trying to fuck you. If they won't talk to you, they'll often talk to your bank/broker/some other bigger player that can convince them that your bankruptcy will also cause significant losses or bankruptcy of another party they're not trying to fuck and they might like to have as friends one day. ""You quit this, and we'll owe you one."" It's always good to have favours to call.

.

2b) The self proclaimed retards on WSB can't be negotiated with. They don't need favours. They don't care if you go bankrupt or there's collateral damage. They don't give a fuck about any of them. For the most part they only hold a few hundred shares each max - and also for the most part, they're playing with their own money that they can actually afford to lose even if it hurts for a year or two. 

How do you negotiate with, or swat a million wasps stinging you? You can't.

Thanks for all the awards guys! I'll soon have enough to make a Tiara and become your Яetard Prince for the day! I was actually expecting posts telling my how wrong I am. I only think I know what the fuck is going on most of the time and usually figure out later that it wasn't.

Use this if you think A stock is overvalued or will crash soon. 4/17 is the expiration date meaning this is how long you have to hold and make money. The closer it gets to the date the more money you can make.

420 Spy P 4/17. This is a put. Think about it as putting your money where your mouth is. If you are putting faith in a company going up you buy puts to the price you think they're going up to.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched an investigation of the trading in shares of Eastman Kodak Co. before and after the news last week of a $765 million government loan to help it make drugs at its U.S. factories, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The loan news caused Kodak's shares to climb to as high as $60, before falling back to $15 on Monday, in massive trading volume. The stock had already moved 25% the day before the news was officially disclosed. Executives with stock options, including some awarded the day before the loan became public, were sitting on big paper gains. Kodak shares were down 1.3% Tuesday, but are up 215% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 has gained 2%.

Short interest is up and some smart retards are on our side. Read the post to raise your IQ from 8 to 9 though. **🐻 🌈s  mega fuk and even posting high level bear shit to scare us.**

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Basically been seeing posts about ""blah blah margin this, short interest this, WS to clever blah"". Going to split this post into distinct sections but im no english degree cuck so dont expect any bear bloomberg  level shit or something

# 1. GME is a fucking steal regardless of squeeze. Buy now or be left on a dying planet while we head to alpha fucking centauri.

So basically everyone here knows about Ryan cohen and his horsemen of the apocalypse coming to steal melvins lunch money. This man bought apple stock in 2017. Hes fucking rich. Hes also an eccommerce wizard, taking CHEWY from a measly 100k co-founded company to a $4 Billion company in 2017 at which point he sold it to petsmart or something. Its now valued at $40 Billion, granted anything eccommerce now gets money thrown at it like a stripper in a high flying strip club or some shit idk im a virgin so dont listen to me, so it may well be a bubble. Regardless the thing grows its revenue like bacteria doing binary fission on agar jelly 🚀🚀🚀🚀.

THEY SELL FUCKING PET FOOD. the market for that is like what? $1?. Gaming is going to the moon and is basically recession proof because of how cheap game is compared to other things for how much you get out of it. Any bears saying that Gamestop cant compete with digital or with amazon. Ryan cohen already slapped amazons head in with a no name brand. Hell fucking do it again. About digital everyone here already knows, microsoft deal, Ryan cohen also mentioned the possibility of having ""Digital game exchanging"" or something, image below.

[Online trade ins. It says online.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/2ba9j5d2zvb61.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b6f3f26c3588fdb8cc779aee8a3b1ce42859f33)

He also mentions streaming, digital content etc and aside from all the digital stuff wants GME to move to a community centric structure where big stores operate with VR centres, Internet cafe, table games like Dungeons and dragons and  40k (rapidly growing somehow will boom post covid) and as we now might know due to this post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme\_dd\_buildapc\_kiosks\_coming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/)

BUILD YOUR OWN PC KIOSKS. This is the literal smell of money. Go to your Gamestop to build your PC with your kid? Gamestop is already the goto place wher your parents go to get you your latest digital fix so now they can go build PC's and it cant go tits up?

**Now for some pussy boomer talk (aka fundametals or something).**

The expected Q3 EPS was -0.84$ or something close to that. The actual loss was -0.53$ but boomzoids only talked about the revenue drop. No shit sherlock its closing all its dead weight stores.

In the holiday report I will talk about a bit more below, 11% of stores were closed and revenue dropped only 3%. Comparitive store sales increased nearly 5%. They cant get enough consoles to sell so expect the momentum to carry on for the whole year I expect. Eccommerce is up 300% over holidays. In Q3 they reported 800% to date. In 2020 Gamestops eccomerce went up 24x. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. Online sales now account for \~33% of Gamestops sales now. This is literally gold dust for ryan cohen.

We are still trading at 0.38 P/S at this price. The average P/S for the SP500 is 2.753. Massive upside on these two numbers alone.

Burry got in this for the MOASS and the intrinsic value. At the time intrinsic value was like $22 and this will pump up as RC takes it to new heights.

GME in Q3 somehow halved the expected loss. Big Bad Boomer sherman somehow didnt fuck it up that bad by saying ""omnichannel"" at the speed of light. Yes the revenue dropped 30% but thats covid for you. As the PC kiosk post above shows GME now sells small items basically so fast they have to have fake stock lmao. The new console cycle always spikes the share price sky high too, as youll see in a crayon drawing later. The potential revenue that this console cycle brings in could be huge. Biggest ever is potentially a true statement and Gamestop sells every fucker they get. Combine the fact that they share game pass ( a massive hit) revenue from the xboxes they sell, something no other retailer has, revenue could be sky high.

Now I know you autists are starting to develop short term dyslexia or something but keep reading. This could be the most important piece of shit you read in your life. How do you think I feel? My brains overheating just trying to write coherent sentences.

Holdiay report was a bear trap imo, saw people saying the decrease in revenue was bearish blah blah blah. Lies. Comparitve store sales rose 5% and thats with some towns having like 4 gamestops. When the leases dont get renewed and these stores get liquidated (Also in Ryan cohens letter) they can just get this influx of cash and pay down debt and invest in logistics and marketing and new growth. Gamestop realistically needs like 1/2 the stores they have now and just need to improve efficiency.

[https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890) this article the messiah himself wrote. In it he states:

>At Chewy, we had maniacal discipline when it came to how we spent money. The company-wide culture of frugality came from his example. Free cash flow was our unwavering governor of growth. We grew Chewy from $200 million in sales in 2013 to $3.5 billion in 2018 while spending only $130 million in capital, all of which went into opening distribution centers across the country and acquiring new customers.

Maniacal. Thats all I need to say. The guy is going to get to mars before papa musk and he wont even break a sweat. When FCF starts to catch up to WS expectations every analyst who donwgraded them is gonna get ditched and upgrades will start to happen.

So in the heading i said its a steal. That implies some future higher price target right? Well here is my guess for a conservative price target based on the information above and also some more I probably forgot cos im a retard.

[The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares \(another reason shorts are fuk\)](https://preview.redd.it/dehiug393wb61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=f198773c36d5109382eb2beba6fade3c059121df)

>The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares (another reason shorts are fuk)

This alone means if for not inflation adjusted terms we reached 9.8Bn or whatever the crayon chart says we should reach:

9.8/2.48 = \~3.95   3.95 \* $35.5 = \~$140. The share price now to reach old mkt cap is $140 fucking dollars. Thats a 4 bagger from now. It gets better.

from [statista](https://statista.com) :

>Considering the **annual inflation rate in the United States** in recent years, a 2.24 percent **inflation rate** is a very moderate projection.

If we take 2.24% inflation, the this share price target in todays money means we should reach $182 because of $140 \* 1.0224\^12, = $182 in adjusted. Thats more than a 5 bagger. basically we could see $10 GME price from short manipulation and buying more is basically a lottery ticket!

I really dont understand the bear thesis. The only bear thesis ( short term this one) was that margin would affect longs more but I looked at it on ortex and its basically bullshit. Buy shares with cash though dont use margin. Own your piece of GME dont borrow it. Bears just spout ""DigITaL"" or ""BlOCKbuSTER"" so much Ryan tweeted a shit emoji at them. All the bears think theyre clever. What the fuck makes those cucks special? How are they different now than the ones from $2, or $4, or $10.

**Bears are betting against:**

Ryan fucking cohen, buisness legend CHEWY from 100k investment, now 40 billion

Michael burry, Investing legend, predicted the housing crisis and is in GME since april

u/DeepFuckingValue , the new WSB god chad, now basically a whale

Reggie Fils-Aimé, gaming and buisness legend, former COO of nintendo

Senvest, a mega fund thats actively managed

Norweigan sovereign wealth fund

Fidelity, Vanguard and blackrock own this shit and are never selling they literally dont give a shit

All of WSB has now formed a shield wall against the bears

Microsoft gave GME highly discounted azure deals and free office use for all employees and a revenue sharing agreement. Bears are stupid if they think MSFT didnt vet GME.

&#x200B;

Some valid bear thesis left now (the only ones left) ----> Ryan Cohen dies.

# 2. Now some analysis on the short squeeze and some technical data on puts and calls and ortex data.

Ok everyone on here and their cat, dog, bedbugs and wifes boyfriend  knows about the squeeze. Jimmy chill aka cramer even talking about it. Gamestop is literally the most shorted stock of all time and space. The squeeze makes every autist salivate because its basically free money while cucking big money out of like what 1% of their fund.

Although I know all you cucks hate shares, and hate holding, if the squeeze doesnt happen selling is probably the most retarded thing anyone could do. Its literally buy high sell low and you fucking disgust me. STONK ONLY GOES UP.

This squeeze is so monumental that its been sucking sharks in like fresh blood. Most of the funds where shorting this from 30-15 dollars before this year so they didnt really care. It all changed with 2 people. u/DeepFuckingValue and Dr. Michael Burry. These guys are as OG as it gets with GME. I think u/DeepFuckingValue may have even sniffed this trade out before the legend himself. Since then funds will have churned this through their rules and started jumping on this train. Ive been in since $13 with 125 shares. If I had more money Id be buying but im just some stupid student ok. Im merely a medium for this money made information.

**The stats for this stock now short wise are, from ortex:**

*Concrete* short interest as of 31 December 2020: **71 Million**.

*Estimated* short interest, *January 11th data:* (This isnt predicted, this is from data in flow, has margin of error) : **77 Million**

Short shares on loan 7 days ago: **50 Million**

Short shares on loan *now* (This breaks the bearish margin calls affect longs more thesis): 54.2 Million

% of known float short: **147%** as of 31 December 2020

% of know free float on loaned shorts: **108%** as of January 11th.

Some [guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyocql/updated_potential_holdings_of_gme/) on here took into account extra buying on wednesday, Institutions, Burry, RC's extra 7% and WSB ownership (something so stupendously  retarded no serious firm will do it) that float on short could be in the 100s of %. Total short float now I would say could be **200-400%** if the numbers are correct.  This pisses on all other short squeezes. Some countries ban shorting above 100% cos of how autistic it is.

The recent hike in interactive brokers available shares is probably a mix of sell off on friday (remember  some guys are now buying lambos with GME money. If they held they could buy 10), calls exercising and puts being covered and brokers ditching the shares. Nakedshort even reported 5 million naked GME shorts on friday. This is bullish as fuck because the best the shorts could do on a red market day was **-10%**.

Gamestop is still on the SECs threshold list for 27 days now.

[This shows naked short selling and downwards pressure hasnt capitulated](https://preview.redd.it/xsetax08pwb61.jpg?width=1083&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=172439b81f509ba01ed3e6489671d6f009298e84)

Need rockets 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀:

Ok so now if WSB owns an estimated 6-8% of the stock and we all know to move over to cash accounts now to avoid margin calls, we should be minimizing longs getting margin called. Every bear on stockwits is a clueless cuck who spouts ""blockbuster"" and these guys dont even know what margin even is so my bet is the colossal **54 Million** shares short on loan are gonna be affected by the margin calls more. Why? Because every long on margin is in the green, and now a true zealot/extremist/autist for ryan cohen so will supply their account with collateral to avoid margin call. Shorts are in the massive red zone. How do I know you ask?

Ortex data from Jan 4th 2021:

[This is the data from ortex for short interest for Gamestop for Jan 4th](https://preview.redd.it/urqb3c3zbwb61.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=d874cd908bad7fe3e8aa4486b5a294f5c1d5724e)

So this shows for jan 4th the estimated short interest is 66.98 Million shares. From the exchange reported 71 Million on december 31st this makes a lot of sense because the share price fell from \~21 to \~17 so shorts took profits. The shares on loan arent for longs too. This is all purely short data, and 47M  shorted at $17 this shows.

These shorts are in a circle of hell we cant comprehend and makes satan scared.

SHARES ON LOAN HAVE GONE UP.  BUT 87% OF LOANED SHORTS WHERE SHORTING AT SUB $20.

Cost to borrow is also up, estimated short interest is up to a cataclysmic amount.

Longs on margin need to supply collateral, but we are in the massive green zone, shorts are underwater. Margin calls will ravage the shorts and sting the longs. We also have the uptick rule in place until the end of the day, so shorts can only short on the way up.

**Seen a lot of talk about Gamma hedging and delta.**

You realize that the fucking bankers and brokers dont understand gamma hedging right? That shits up their with the black-scholes equation and feynman-kac solution. Forget about it. The retards claiming to understand it are either payed by hedge funds or lose money. The guy who took out outs thinking options exercising and gamma hedging would lead to a collossal sell off on friday lost money on his puts because **no one** except some quants in a goldman sachs server room know this shit. The idea is simple about neutral delta on options that people take out, but the simple system interacts with every other thing in the stock market, and wow who couldve guessed it, like nearly any other element of the stock market predicting something by the day is nigh impossible. That guy talking about Gamma , Delta and margin calls is on weeklies. Hes no more autistic and equally retarded as all of us. Hes a chill guy though so dont berate a fellow brother.

**Now weve established the likelihood of longs getting margin called is far smaller than shorts, on to the options distributions**

**Two images now: Top one is before the end of the 15th, the other one is after market close:**

&#x200B;

[This shows the suspected melvin puts \(51000 contracts, 5 Million shares, rolled up from july, strike price $24\) and lots of big ITM calls.](https://preview.redd.it/t8odq9btgwb61.jpg?width=821&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61bb8a66e0ed83f0315921c295d1851a3c20c6c0)

[This shows the big put contract didnt get rolled over and the big ITM calls got exercised on friday. Large puts are underwater big timem while calls are in the big tendy zone.](https://preview.redd.it/3nqb33f0hwb61.jpg?width=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9dc83f542dcc3565ae0424121146101b73cf0083)

These two graphs, show before market close and after. As we can see the massiver 51000 put contracts didnt get rolled over and the chances that those were melvins july puts rolled up is very high. They expired worthless. Lots of calls are printing big time while huge amounts of puts are worthless and bleeding money.

Something else we can extrapolate from the charts is that massive options trades are not present on the scale we saw before (tens of thousands).

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

We are seeing a discrepancy in the number of puts/calls opening up at the higher prices with calls gaining fast. This could show that some funds are now becoming optimistic on the long or short term prospects of gamestop. There are also more puts than options and if we assume this for shorts vs longs on margin (without even taking into account that all shorts are borrowed shares and pay interest further bleeding cash) then shorts are likely on more margin than longs.

Regardless fellow autists my main point is two show that the bears are underwater and the bulls are flying high with regards to options.

**Now lets compare this possible squeeze with others.**

Bear in mind this is the most shorted stock of all time, but differences in free float change the share price differently.

Kodak went from **$2.16 to $33.2**

Volkswagen went from **\~200 euro to nearly 1000.**

Overstock went from **\~$21 to $123**

Blue apron went from **$2.31 to $18**

Ive been seeing some estimated that 1 million shares is roughly a dollars move in share price. This maths is about to be pretty autistic so bear with me degnerates.

$1 now is 2.81% of the share price. Everything in the markets is exponential and based on percentages. So if we assume a full squeeze of ortexs estimated short interest (This assumes no sell off and no new shorts, new shorts can be positive or negative depedning on when in the squeeze they happen) **$35.5 \* 1.0281\^77 = $299.** GME to moon. 🌑 .

This shit can happen. Hold on.

**GME has squeezed and been manipulated before and it always happens around the console cycles. Shorts never win and they wont win now.**

[This post right here I found months ago and got me in the squeeze from the honourable and valiant u\/Uberkikz aka Rod Alzman](https://preview.redd.it/4ysv7bzclwb61.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=27ac6ac58b6366f81b53fa75966733b8a8d61d3c)

Basically the crayon chart shows green (outstanding shares) orange ( short shares) purple (Market cap) and cyan (Share price). In 2006-2008 the share price rose in tandem with short interest ( Like now ) Until console releases when you can see an abrupt squeeze happend mooning the share price.

This happend to a degree in 2013 with the xbox one but worse conditions for the company and a worse console launch lead to slow short covering but the share price still mooned.

Now we get to the best part. History is repeating itself for the third time and the shares sold short are literally higher than the outstanding shares, which have been decreasing since 2010. Short shares are also at the highest point ever and GME hasnt had a brighter future, well ever. Ps5 and Xbox Series X. are the two most hyped consoles since the Ps2. This is setting up the foundations for massive price movements weve never seen before. This shit has literally never happend, ever. Uncharted waters and we are the captain.

**For the insurmountably retarded autists who think that the squeeze has happend look upon this and despair:**

IHOR IS A MEGA WIZARD

Ihor I quote:

>**A long-buying tsunami ... is the primary factor for the price move**

Ihor Dusaniwsky is managing director of predictive analytics at S3 a firm similar to ortex. He told bloomberg that the squeeze hasnt happend yet and that this was long buying. If someone knows this shit its him. He was talking about the tesla squeeze in january 2020. He has access to resources we can only imagine. Barrons cut his comment that the squeeze hasnt happend yet out it was that fucking bullish. All the media ramming down ""Short squeeze has happend"" down peoples throats because bears are fucking scared.

The bots on stocktwits spamming bearish sentiment should show how rattled they are.

Edit: **You fucking degens just enlightened me that cramer pump is real, funds are ruminating over the long weekend, and stmmy bills pumps stonks and that stimmy bill buys many an xbox. See you at andromeda! Also more rockets.**

>There’s also the chance of a ratings upgrade. Moody’s and S&P have GME at B3 and B-, which is rated “highly speculative”. Ratings are reviewed every quarter, and a review might be due this month (i.e. this coming week or next). Good chance that the agencies might upgrade GME to a B2/B, or even better to the next higher band (Ba/BB).

I haven't been happy in my 1 year-relationship. My girlfriend probably moved in with me with the expectation that I'll **pay her $40k Nursing School debt THAT SHE NEVER EVEN GRADUATED FROM (and she never told me about this debt**)**.** She was working as a receptionist but quit when we moved in because of 'mental health issues'.

Honestly I've taken her to a psychologist, cared for her, even took some leave just to spend time with her and help her recover. I give her alone time when she asks for it. And when I'm at home, I always do the chores and ask her if she's game to go eat something nice and spend more time together.

One day, I pull up to our condo and my door is open. I see some other *fucking guy* leaving my house, and he looks like he's been on a million different drugs.

Pissed, I ask her about it and she gets angry at me, asking me why I'm never home and why I always abuse her. She dodges the question over and over and says that it's just 'a friend' she opened the door to because no one was home to keep her company. This happens about 2 more times and one day, I confront the guy in the front door and turns out he's '**rented**'.

First off. Where did she get the money? Has she been renting guys out with the little ""salary"" I'm giving her to spend while I'm working my ass off  providing for both of us? I'm a freaking security guard earning $19 CAD/hr. Which is not bad but not sustainable for a relationship where one person pays for two.

I was pissed to hell.

There was something she didn't know about, though. I've been stashing away a little bit of money, starting with 5K CAD after finding about this reddit site. At that time, I was honestly depressed because I had a hard time paying for our condo and with debt. And perhaps that fueled me with all-inning that 5K with a PLTR options play (call) that expired Nov 27, 2020. Oct 30, 2020 when I bought multiple calls for PLTR it rockets all the way to **wakanda** and to **jupiter**. I'm now 1012% up. I cash out before Citron shorts it. **(DW I'll add that money to buying PLTR STOCKS**, less riskier than doing options).

***How does this relate to my girlfriend?***

It relates. It relates because I'm going to leave her fucking ass. Actually, even if PLTR doesn't hit $40 I'm STILL going to leave her ass. I have to pay spousal support, because of our cohabitation agreement, but when I looked at the calculator online, it amounts to about $82 per month for **0.5** to **1 year**. I'll do it and then cut all ties. And that bitch'll have to handle her debt herself. I'll cut all ties and leave without a fuckin word.

It's not like we are obligated to one another. I haven't committed to her through marriage. And this is my decision.

So her, that 'rental' guy, Jim Cramer, and CITRON can go suck my hard, throbbing cock because PLTR is making 50k liters of blood gush into it every time it goes up. Goodbye and I'll see you Monday when that shit pumps to the moon and beyond.",2020-11-29 11:22:37

You mischaracterized both the type of people involved in this action (literate, engaged, working poor to middle-class) and the action itself (is it greedy to spend our paychecks wringing dry hedge funds who daily manipulate the markets in milliseconds while we are forced to drop a few bucks here and there and hope for the best?).

They do shit like mudding and driving on dirt roads, Elon stop it

They need to haul tools and shit for work, nobody and I mean nobody is pulling up on a job site with this fucking thing.

They pull campers and trailers, you think the lame ass dude pulling a camper arrives at  Yogi Bear Park with the family in the Cyber punk truck

They have a small dick, these fucks want something more flashy, women need to know they have money, a 40k garbage can on wheels won't cut it.

 I showed this truck to my test group of Beckys they thought it was movie prop. I told one of them, imagine we are on a date and the truck breaks down on the way home,  lucky for us I got an ATV charging in the back and I can give you a ride home still. She left me on ""unread""

123,Today was a coordinated attack by institutions against the longs. Here's how it played out.,12656,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4zbff/today_was_a_coordinated_attack_by_institutions/,1955,"I was long at the beginning of the day and held throughout. From the dizzying highs to soul-crushing lows. I even bought a bit more at the midpoint prices of today. From my observations, this is how the institutions conspired to crush the longs in order to give the shorts breathing room to cover.

1. The beginning of the day was intentional. They let fomo run GME all the way into the sky with almost no resistance whatsoever.

2. However, at around 10-10:30 AM EST, something odd happened. The brokers suddenly jacked up their margin requirements for GME. My portfolio previously had a lot of buying power, which suddenly disappeared.

3. We were intentionally allowed to break 150 (which is the highest option strike available) in order to make everyone fomo even harder. Then, the dump came, and it was vicious. At the same time, CNBC started an hour-long segment bashing GME nonstop. Only Cramer provided a bit of token resistance. Every other analyst was calling this move unwarranted and warning that tons of people will be bagholding.

4. As a result, everyone who chased in on margin got fucked. Even my sizeable portfolio was margin called. Fortunately, while I'm retarded, I'm not the most retarded and was not all in GME and was using only a little margin. I was able to cover easily. The unfortunate morons who fomo'd in on margin above today's open were not so lucky. I imagine a lot of retards got liquidated on the way down.

5. The cascading effect let us fill the gap completely and even a little past. However, the important point is that we closed above Friday's close at +18% for the day. I see this as very bullish. So keep holding and don't fucking sell into the fear the other side tried to create. Going forward, stop buying GME on heavy margin. Use cash accounts if possible. Don't let yourself be set up as a domino piece for the shorts to knock over into everyone else.

**TLDR: MMers, brokers, and shorts conspired to screw us. They let us run price up, then jacked up margin requirements, and finally dumped. Despite that, we defended Friday's close quite well so DON'T FUCKING SELL.**",2021-01-26 09:27:21

Modern portfolio theory has been based on the foundational idea for the past 3 decades that both equities and bonds are inversely correlated. However, as some people have realized, both stocks and bonds are both increasing in value and decreasing in value at the same time.[\[1\]](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/upshot/markets-weird-coronavirus.html) This approach to investing is used pretty much in everyone's 401K, target date retirement plans, or other forms of passive investing. If both bonds and equities are losing value, what will happen to firms implementing these strategies on a more generalized basis known as risk-parity? Firms such as Bridgewater, Bluecrest, and H2O assets have been blowing up. \[[2](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-14/dalio-s-macro-fund-plunged-about-20-this-year-as-market-tanked),[3](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-03-13/bluecrest-shrinks-from-relative-value-trades-amid-losses-exits)\]

Liquidity has been drying up in the markets for the past two weeks.[\[4\]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-14/traders-nightmare-liquidity-vanished-when-they-needed-it-most) The liquidity crisis has been in the making since the 2008 financial crisis, after the passage of Dodd-Frank and Basel III. Regulations intended to regulate the financial industry have instead created the one of the largest backstops to Fed intervention as the Fed tried to pump liquidity into the market through repo operations. What is a repo?

>A repo is a secured loan contract that is collateralized by a security. A repo transaction facilitates the sale and future repurchase of the security that serves as collateral between the two parties: (1) the borrower who owns a security and seeks cash and (2) the lender who receives the security as collateral when lending the cash. The cash borrower sells securities to the cash lender with the agreement to repurchase them at the maturity date. Over the course of the transaction, the cash borrower retains the ownership of the security. On the maturity date, the borrower returns the cash with interest to the lender and the collateral is returned from the lender to the borrower.[\[5\]](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018027pap.pdf)

Banks like Bank of New York Mellon and JP Morgan Chase act as a clearing bank to provide this liquidity to other lenders through a triparty agreement.\[[6](https://www.jpmorgan.com/jpmpdf/1320634324649.pdf)\] In short, existing regulations make it unfavorable to take on additional repos due to capital reserve requirement ratios, creating a liquidity crunch.\[[7](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-12/financial-markets-need-temporary-close-like-the-one-after-9-11),[8](https://www.biancoresearch.com/the-moment-in-this-decline-has-arrived-2/),[9](https://www.jpmorgan.com/jpmpdf/1320634324649.pdf)\] What has the Fed done to address this in light of these facts?

>In light of the shift to an ample reserves regime, the Board has reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective on March 26, the beginning of the next reserve maintenance period.[\[10\]](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm)

**II. Signs of Exhaustion & The Upcoming Bounce is a Trap, We Have Far More to Go**

A simple indicator to use is the relative strength index (RSI) that a lot of WSB is familiar with. RSI is not the be all and end all. There's tons of indicators that also are indicating we are at a very oversold point.

[SPY 1 Yr\/1 Day RSI](https://preview.redd.it/vshsz3wyd1o41.png?width=2086&format=png&auto=webp&s=a122fdedb45c84cc441132aa0d0a7265476c4c22)

Given selling waves, there are areas of key support and resistance. For reference, I have not changed key lines since my original charts except for the colors. You can check in my previous posts. 247.94 has been critically an area that has been contested many times, as seen in the figure below. For those that bought calls during the witching day, RIP my fellow autists. The rejection of 247.94 and the continued selling below 233.86 signals to me more downside, albeit, it's getting exhausted. Thus, I expect the next area in which we start rallying is 213.

Another contrarian indicator for buying calls is that notable people in finance have also closed their shorts. These include Jeffery Gundlach, Kevin Muir, and Raoul Pal.\[[11](https://twitter.com/TruthGundlach/status/1240394134717947905),[12](https://themacrotourist.substack.com/p/governments-are-panicking),[13](https://twitter.com/realvision/status/1240688338912169990)\]

**III. The Dollar, Gold, and Oil**

As previously stated, cash is being hoarded by not only primary banks, but central banks around the world. This in turn has created a boom in the dollar's strength, despite limitless injections of cash (if you think 1 trillion of Repo is the ceiling, think again) by the Fed.

[DXY](https://preview.redd.it/477uixirq1o41.png?width=2600&format=png&auto=webp&s=173721c0bd69a6f277493baf0dfc04b59570f7d6)

Despite being in a deflationary environment, the DXY has not achieved such levels since 2003. Given the dollar shortage around the world, it is not inconceivable that we reach levels of around 105-107. For disclosure, I have taken a long position in UUP. However, with all parabolic moves, they end in a large drop. To summarize, the Fed needs to take action on its own currency due to the havoc it's causing globally, and will need to crush the value of the dollar, which will likely coincide with the time that we near 180.

If we are indeed headed towards 180, then gold will keep selling off. WSB literally screams bloody guhhhhhh when gold sells off. However, gold has been having an amazing run and has broken out of its long term channel. In times of distress and with margin calls, heavy selling of equities selling off of gold in order to raise cash. As previously noted, in this deflationary environment, everything is selling off from stocks, to bonds, to gold.

What about oil? Given the fall out of the risk parity structure, I'm no longer using TLT inflows/outflows as an indicator. I've realized that energy **is** the economy. Closely following commodities such as light crude which follow supply and demand more closely have provided a much better leading indicator as to what will happen in equities. Given that, oil will also most likely hit a relief rally. But ultimately, we have seen it reach as low $19/barrel during intraday trading.

**IV. The Next 5 Years**

In short, the recovery from this deflationary environment will take years to recover from. The trend down will not be without large bumps. We cannot compare this on the scale of the 2008 financial crisis. This is on the order of 1929. Once we hit near 180, the Fed crushes the dollar, we are in a high likelihood of hitting increased inflation, or stagflation. At this point the Fed will be backed into a corner and forced to raise rates. My targets for gold are around 1250-1300. It may possibly go near to 1000. Oil could conceivably go as low as $15-17/barrel, so don't go all in on the recovery bounce. No matter what, the current rise in gold will be a trap. The continued selling in the S&P is a trap, will bounce, forming another trap, before continuing our painful downtrend.

I haven't even mentioned coronavirus and unemployment until now. I've stated previously we are on track to hit around at least 10,000 coronavirus cases by the end of this month. It's looking closer to now 20-30,000. Next month we are looking to at least 100,000 by the end of the April. We might hit 1,000,000 by May or June.

**tl;dr We're going to have a major reflexive rally starting around 213, all the way back to at least to 250, and possibly 270. WSB is going to lose their minds holding their puts, and then load up on calls, declaring we've reached a bottom in the stock market. The next move will be put in place for the next leg down to 182, where certain actors will steal all your tendies on the way down. Also Monday might be another circuit breaker.**

**tl;dr of tl;dr Big bounce incoming. Bear trap starting 213. Then bull trap up around 250-270. We're going down to around 182.**

&#x200B;

Update 1 3/22/2020 - Limit down 3 minutes of futures. Likely hit -7% circuit breaker on the cash open on Monday at 213 as stated previously.

Do not think we will hit the 2nd circuit breaker at 199.06. Thinking we bounce, not too much, but stabilize at least around 202.97.

Update 2 3/23/20 9:08 - Watching the vote before making any moves.

9:40 - sold 25% of my SPY puts and 50% of my VXX calls

9:45 - sold another 50% of SPY puts

9:50 - just holding 25% SPY puts now and waiting for the vote/other developments

11:50 - Selling all puts.

Starting my long position.

11:55 - Sold USO puts.

12:00 - Purchased VXX puts to vega hedge.

2:45 - Might sell calls EOD. Looks like a lot of positioning for another leg down before going back up.

It's pretty common to shake things out in order to make people to sell positions. Just FYI, I do intraday trading. If you can't, just wait for EOD for the next positioning.

3:05 - Seeing a massive short on gold. Large amounts of calls on treasuries. And extremely large positioning for more shorts on SPY/SPX.

Will flip into puts.

Lot of people keep DM'ing me. I'm only going to do this once.

&#x200B;

That said, I'm going back into puts. Just goes to show how tricky the game is.

3:45 - As more shorts cover, going to sell the calls and then flip into puts around the last few min of close.

Hope you guys made some money on the cover and got some puts. I'll write a short update later explaining how they set up tomorrow, especially with the VIX dropping so much.

3/24/20 - So the rally begins. Unfortunately misread the options volume. The clearest signal was the VIX dropping the past few days even though we kept swinging lower, which suggested that large gap downs were mostly over and the rally is getting started.

Going to hold my puts since they are longer dated. Going to get a few short term calls to ride this wave.

10:20 - VIX still falling, possibility of a major short squeeze coming in if SPY breaks out over 238-239.

10:45 - Opened a small GLD short, late April expiration.

10:50 - Sold calls, just waiting, not sure if we break 238.

If we go above 240, going back into calls. See room going to 247 or 269. Otherwise, going to start adding to my puts.

https://preview.redd.it/ag5s0hccxmo41.png?width=2032&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad730db4164720483a8b60056243d6e4a8a0cab

11:10 - Averaging a little on my puts here. Again, difficult to time the entries. Do not recommend going all in at a single time. Still watching around 240 closely.

11:50 - Looks like it's closing. Still going to wait a little bit.

12:10 - Averaged down more puts. Have a little powder left, we'll see what happens for the rest of today and tomorrow.

2:40 - Closed positions, sitting on cash. Waiting to see what EOD holds. Really hard trading days.

3:00 - Last update. What I'm trying to do here posting some thoughts is for you guys to take a look at things and make some hypotheses before trading. Getting a lot of comments and replies complaining. If you're tailing, yes there is risk involved. I've mentioned sizing appropriately, and locking in profits. Those will help you get consistent gains.

Bounced off 10 year trendline at around 246, pretty close to 247. Unless we break through that the rally is over. Given that, could still see us going to 270.

3/25/20 - I wouldn't read too much into the early moves. Be careful of the shakeouts.

Still long. Price target, 269. When does the month end? Why is that important?

12:45 - out calls.

12:50 - adding a tranche of SPY puts. Adding GLD puts.

1:00 est - saving rest of my dry powder to average if we still continue to 270. Think we drop off a cliff after the end of the quarter.

Just a little humor... hedge funds and other market makers [right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAf0QnLFS7Q).

2:00pm - Keep an eye on TLT and VXX...

3:50pm - Retrace to the 10 yr trend line. Question is if we continue going down or bounce. So I'm going to explain again, haven't changed these lines. Check the charts from earlier.

https://preview.redd.it/9qiqyndtivo41.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=55cf84f2b9f5a8099adf8368d9f3034b0e3c4ae4

3/26/20 - Another retest of the 10 yr trendline. If it can go over and hold, can see us moving higher.

9:30 - Probably going to buy calls close to the open. Not too sure, seems like another trap setting up. Might instead load up on more puts later today.

In terms of unemployment, was expecting close to double. Data doesn't seem to line up. That's why we're bouncing. California reported 1 million yesterday alone, and unemployment estimates were 1.6 million? Sure.

Waiting a little to see the price action first.

Treasuries increasing and oil going down?

9:47 - Added more to GLD puts.

10:11 - Adding more SPY puts and IWM puts.

10:21 - Adding more puts.

11:37 - Relax guys, this move has been expected. Take care of yourselves. Eat something, take a walk. Play some video games. Don't stare at a chart all day.

If you have some family or close friends, advise them not to buy into this rally. I've had my immediate family cash out or switch today into Treasury bonds/TIPS.

4:00pm - Don't doubt your vibe.

For those that keep asking about my vibe... yes, we could hit 270. I literally said we could hit 270 when we were at 218. There was a lot of doubt. Just sort by best and look at the comments. Can we go to 180 from 270? Yes. I mentioned that EOM is important.

Here's another prediction. VIX will hit ATH again.

2:55pm EST - For DM's chat is not working now. Will try to get back later tonight.

125,I am financially ruined (agricultural futures),12583,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzoh1c/i_am_financially_ruined_agricultural_futures/,1191,"I have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound.

126,GME - Listen to this german guy: The most important thing until Friday.,12208,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5fsbw/gme_listen_to_this_german_guy_the_most_important/,1791,"Just translated something from german wsb. And was asked to post this as a discussion.

The most important thing is actually **until Friday there** will be another **price** battle in which the short sellers will try to keep as many calls as possible outside the price so that they cannot be executed and the broker does not have to buy them on the market to cover them .  
It is particularly critical because **monthly and weekly calls** expire, as far as I know the highest monthly call was **60c 1/29** and **115c 1/29** (left out the new 200c).

The MM will try everything to push the course **below 60** , **our goal to get to 115** . Until then, **expect massive short attacks** , it will probably be even more blatant than yesterday. Since a price limit is harder to keep higher up, don't be surprised if there is a red tag up until then or the lower limit is 60-80.  
For those of you who don't know what is meant, 100xLimit orders at $ 60 are $ 6000 <$ 11500 100x at $ 115 and easier to hold or buy from autistic people.

And almost most importantly **, put your stop loss out** , the **shortsellers try** to trigger as many as possible with their short sales in order to trigger **a chain reaction of panic selling** .

Remember **yesterday we saw exactly that** , price dumping at its finest, although almost no short position was powered.

Should we be **able to hold the $ 115 by Friday** , the banks (! Not the shortsellers) would have to buy an additional 8 million shares to cover the demand for the calls. To achieve this there is really only the possibility 🚀✋🏻💎🤚🏻,

**Don't be a paper bitch!**

* Since filing for bankruptcy in late May, Hertz has surged 825%.
* That's not what investors normally expect for a company that declared it can't meet its debt obligations.
* Hertz has surged higher following a steady drip of positive economic data that points to a recovery from the damage caused by the coronavirus.
* While retail investors on **Robinhood** loaded up on the stock, billionaire investor Carl Icahn liquidated his entire stake at 70 cents a share, for a loss of more than $1.8 billion.

The Corporate Accountability and Democracy Plan would also eliminate many of the tax breaks and loopholes in the tax code and do away with off-shore tax havens.

The senator is also calling to democratize corporate boards, ban stock buybacks and diversify corporations.

The detailed plan includes these highlights, according to the campaign website:

- Nearly half of the board of directors in any large corporation with at least $100 million in annual revenue, corporations with at least $100 million in balance sheet total, and all publicly traded companies would be directly elected by the firm's workers.

- They would be required to consider the interests of all of the stakeholders in a company – including workers, customers, shareholders and the communities in which the corporation operates.

- Large-scale stock buybacks would be ""treated like stock manipulation"" via repeal of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 10b-18.

- Rules would be developed to diversify corporate boards ""ensuring a significant portion of every board be comprised of people from historically underrepresented groups."" And they would require every corporation to ""complete an annual report that gives the compensation, gender, and racial composition of board and employees.""

If you make a post and think it's a quality contribution to the subreddit send a message to modmail and we can approve it.**

The last two days have seen something like 200 post removals to start with, so with WSB going private and it being 7pm already, which is when we're typically light on mods, I'm just going to step in and stop this nonsense for the time being.

Also, Reddit has been having server issues all day meaning automod is just fucking up all over the place and not doing it's job.  This also means modmail is on the fritz, so if you don't get a response in a timely manner I apologize but there's not a lot we can do about it - I couldn't even message other mods to warn em I was doing this.  Reddit is a shitshow rn and we can't spend our whole night fixing it unfortunately.  If people weren't spamming the sub with garbage all day we wouldn't be here. 

Lastly, as a PSA to all of the people who think they've been on WSB for a while and are confused: you haven't been on WSB for a while if this is confusing.  They regularly go private.  It's not the SEC, it's not the FBI, it's not whomever else they say is investigating them.  It's because the mods are tired of dealing with noobs that flood the sub after a media event so they just shut it down.  Hopefully that don't hit ya like a brick in the ol cranium...   

This is why we can't have nice things.

Apologies to all the real ones.

E: Just FYI, if you're messaging modmail about getting a post approved, and your post is about GME, Short squeezes, your thoughts on shorts, or whatever else, then there's a 99.99% chance it's not getting approved unless you have a very in depth analysis or some new and important news item.  Add your thoughts to one of the existing threads.

e2: looks like they're back, I'm still going to keep the post block here for a bit, prior to WSB going down we had probably 40 threads that should have been comments in existing threads.  To be completely honest we have been in need of some sort of overhaul in both moderation and rules for some time - the onslaught of frankly very low effort posts over the last few days has only served to expose just how much we rely on users to do the right thing with regard to posting, this isn't the thread for that, and I'm slammed at work, but it's gotta happen at some point.

e3: y'all, 5 people DMd me and 6 others messaged our modmail asking for access to WSB.  That is NOT how reddit works lol.  I do think this is illustrative of how many people have flocked to this sub and this site without understanding any of it recently.

168,Gamestop Big Picture: The Short Singularity,4139,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l5l413/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity/,2544,"*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch.*

There are numerous posts on this sub and others diving into the technical guts behind some of the recent moves behind GME, so I will keep it high level for everyone scratching their heads wondering what's going on.

There has been much talk on CNBC and in other financial media calling what's happening in GME a distortion of the market and an unjustifiable departure from the fundamentals. That is undeniably true. That being said, the distortion is not what's playing out now, but rather what happened about 1.5 years ago when short interest in GME first began to approach (and later exceed) 100% of the available float.

Short selling is usually a tool that aids in price discovery, but like most market mechanisms, at the extremes things get more complicated.

Short sellers, having borrowed shares, are guaranteed (indeed obligated) future buyers of the stock. They put themselves in that position on the thesis that there are reasons to expect the stock price to go down, such that when they buy the shares back they can return what they borrowed at a lower price and pocket the difference. As such, as short interest grows, there is a short term downard push on the price (the initial sale of the borrowed shares), but also future upside pull on the stock price as a natural result, kind of like gravity, but pulling the price upward. Normally that pressure is so slight and subtle that short interest in and of itself should not be a mover of the stock price.

That being said, a common rule of thumb is that you should start to concern yourself with that pressure when short interest crosses the threshold of between 20% and 25% of the effective float (shares actually available to trade). At that level and above, the pressure starts to become noticeable, kind of like the moon causing currents and tides.

GME short interest was recently **140%** of the float. In recent days, short interest has actually continued to accumulate (I'll explain why later).

There is, in effect, a critical mass of short interest hanging over GME's price exerting not subtle pull, but face-ripping force like the gravity of a black hole. A short singularity, if you will.

Previous short squeeze case studies such as VW or KBIO were all about someone engineering a way for effective float to evaporate, suddenly leaving what was previously a relatively reasonable aggregate short interest position in a world of hurt. This is the first time where we're seeing a situation play out where it wasn't someone engineering a shrinkage of effective float, but large market-moving players simply blowing up the short interest to the point where it simply overtook effective float by a large margin. Why would they do that? Because they expected GME to declare bankruptcy in the very near term so that returning borrowed shares costs $0, as the shares are worthless at that point. Also, an arguably intentional side-effect of this massive artificial sell-side pressure on the stock is that it becomes more difficult for GME to obtain any kind of financing to avoid bankruptcy, making it, in theory, a self-fulfilling prophecy. GME, however, did not go bankrupt for reasons that are well explained by other posters.

In order to close their positions and limit their exposure (which remains theoretically infinite otherwise), short interest holders need to collectively buy back more shares than are available on the market, and especially since GME is no longer at risk of imminent bankruptcy, that buying action would push the price into a parabolic upward move, likely forcing brokers to liquidate short interest-holding accounts across the board on the way to buy shares at any price to cover their otherwise infinite liability exposure (and that forced covering will push the price further upward into a feedback loop--like crossing the event horizon of the black hole in our analogy).

So what is happening now, and where do we go from here?

Right now, short-side interests are desperately trying to drive the price down. There has been an across-the-board media blitz to try to scare investors away from GME. But there is really only one way to drive price down directly, and that is selling. In fact, given that most of the large holders of GME long positions are simply sitting on their shares, it means selling. even. more. shares. short.

Even as price has been grinding upward, and liquidity has been evaporating, short sellers, who have lost billions mark-to-market currently (my guess is on the order of $10bn by the end of trading today), can only keep selling, piling on even more exposure and losses, staving off oblivion hour by hour, minute by minute.

GME might also decide to issue more shares to recapitalize its business on the back of the elevated share price, but it is unlikely they could issue enough shares to change the overall trajectory of the stock at this point (especially not given their fiduciary responsibility to current stock holders). It might, however, run the clock out a little while longer.

At this point it looks like there will either be some type of external market intervention by regulators (though I can't see any reason for them to step in myself), or we will soon see what happens when short positions representing \~$8bn in current mark-to-market liability goes parabolic.

169,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,4089,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l3z5jq/i_created_an_algo_that_tracks_the_most_hyped/,361,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

I learned the following on here: 

You can not time the markets. It is impossible. The market is irrational. Keep your money in and keep investing. Time is your friend. The market will go up over long periods of time.

And now in 2020 I am seeing the following advice being pushed:

I know better than the markets. The markets will drop. I can surely time this. It’s not me that’s wrong it’s the market. The market is not responding correctly to bad news.

I am even seeing people over emphasize negative news stories about the virus or the economy. It seems there is a growing resentment from people holding cash that may have missed catching a falling knife - which we always knew to be incredibly difficult.

The fact of the matter is we don’t know how the market will behave. For us average investors it is best to keep putting money in and holding or dollar cost averaging. Ignore everything else.",2020-04-30 03:03:00

All that needs to be done is identify public companies with major product lines enjoyed particularly by basic white girls and equal weight them.

* LRLCY

* LVMUY

EDIT: I'm back in this thread, and I agree about several of the proposed additions, most notably TIF. A lot of you are asking why I left out SNAP, though. I simply forgot about it, but even if I didn't, it's been public for such a short time that it would screw up any decent backtest, and I would probably not include a company with no history of positive EPS anyways. That said, if any of you put some money into a scheme like this, feel free to add or subtract whatever you want. I am powerless to stop you.

EDIT2: In accordance with community consensus, we can go ahead and add these:

* ETSY

* FIZZ

* GOOS

* NFLX

* SNAP

* TGT

* TIF

188,Sears files for bankruptcy,3673,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/9o9w1u/sears_files_for_bankruptcy/,630,"Per CNBC - After years of [Sears Holdings](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SHLD) staying afloat through financial maneuvering and relying on billions of CEO Eddie Lampert's own money, the 125-year-old retailer filed for bankruptcy.

The filing comes more than a decade after Lampert merged Sears and Kmart, hoping that forging together the two struggling discounters would create a more formidable competitor.

It comes after Lampert [shed assets and spun out real estate](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/18/eddie-lampert-says-sears-is-shrinking-shedding-assets-to-stay-alive.html), all to pay down the debt the retailer accumulated when that plan went askew. The company still has roughly 700 stores, which have at times been barren, unstocked by vendors who have lost their trust. Many of the stores have never been visited by a generation of shoppers that can barely recall it was once the the country's biggest retailer.

Lampert, who has a controlling ownership stake in Sears, personally holds some 31 percent of the retailer's shares outstanding, according to FactSet. His hedge fund ESL Investments owns about 19 percent.

Ultimately, it was a $134 million payment that did the company in. The company had a payment due Monday it had not the money to pay.

Other forces were at play too. Sears' creditors refused to agree to a [restructuring proposal](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/24/sears-ceo-proposes-restructuring-plan-to-avoid-bankruptcy.html). They had little assurance by way of collateral or strategy, after years upon years in which Sears' only shot at survival came by selling off parts of its business. Over 42 quarters, only one yielded positive same-store sales growth. As of late September, Sears tallied $5.6 billion in current debt.

Its board was in a perilous spot. Its special committee was tasked with approving Lampert's other plan, [a bid to buy his storied Kenmore appliance business and other brands](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/23/eddie-lamperts-hedge-fund-esl-proposes-to-buy-kenmore-brand-sears-real-estate.html). Approving his offer would have helped Sears make its payment. But it would also thrust the board the spotlight, potentially opening them to the threat of litigation from shareholders who might allege Lampert has stripped the business bare.

#### Homes to Hardware

That business was once a giant. It started with Richard Sears, [who launched the Sears Watch Co. in 1886](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/timeline-the-rise-and-fall-of-sears.html) to sell watches by mail. The company later evolved into Sears, Roebuck and Co., which sold everything from homes to hardware through a catalog. The convenience brought its products to America's most rural locations.

In 1925, Sears morphed a mail-order plant on Chicago's West Side into its first retail store. By the end of the year. Sears opened seven more stores. Eventually, Sears became the largest U.S. retailer, and its house brands like Kenmore and Craftsman earned spots as staples in homes across the country. Generations of children marked the holidays by paging through its holiday catalog, known as the ""Wishbook,"" wondering if they would receive any of the toys inside.

As Sears success grew, so did its empire. It moved into Chicago's iconic Sears Tower, and for a time, owned financial services businesses like Dean Witter and Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group.

But [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT) topped Sears as the biggest U.S. retailer in 1990. Its efforts to attract female shoppers by showing them the ""softer side of Sears"" and move into new businesses lines left it without a identity.

Those challenges didn't stop Lampert, the hedge fund manager who had already impressed Wall Street with his acumen when he seemingly turned around Kmart, which he bought in 2004. He acquired and combined Sears with Kmart in 2005, arguing that two ailing retailers were stronger together than apart. The financial guru saw valuable real estate, customers he could parlay from one store to the other and ample costs to cut.

The retail giant he created had a market capitalization north of $20 billion in 2006. The media began to wonder whether he was the ""next Warren Buffett."" Lampert could have sold off his investments then, but stayed on, steadfast in his vision of the combined retailers.

Meanwhile, Walmart and [Target](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TGT) kept opening stores, as did [Lowe's](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=LOW)and [Home Depot](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=HD). Walmart touted its ""everyday low prices,"" while Target served up ""cheap chic."" Lowe's and Home Depot provided a wider array of home improvement products for all kinds of projects, making it tough for Kenmore and Craftsman to compete.

Then, came a double blow.

Consumer spending slowed during the Great Recession, especially for big-ticket items like washers and dryers. Cash-strapped shoppers began using the internet to hunt down the best deals. Gradually, they began to spend more online and avoid the mall, fueling Amazon's rise. Sears' 140,000-square-foot stores began to seem monstrous as foot traffic declined.

Walmart and others began to invest in their businesses to compete with Amazon, but Sears never had that chance. It simply didn't have the funds.

Sears' last profitable year was in 2010. A thinning cash flow has left little money to put back into the company itself, letting it become more irrelevant. For the past five years, the ratio of Sears' capital expenditures to sales has been less than one percent. That's even as its sales have more than halved in the same time period.

Sears has been in survival mode for more than a decade. Unable to rely on the Sears' business to pay the bills, [Lampert instead sold or spun off many of its most valuable stores and brands](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/timeline-the-rise-and-fall-of-sears.html).

Since its merger with Kmart, Sears has spun off its Lands' End clothing brand, sold the Craftsman tool brand to [Stanley Black & Decker](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/) and closed hundreds of stores. It spun out 250 of its best properties into real estate investment trust offshoot known as [Seritage](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SRG).

Its key vendors, wary of Sears' future, [demanded tighter payment terms](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/08/sears-same-store-sales-q3-2017.html). Some, like Whirlpool, [stopped shipping all-together.](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/24/sears-cuts-ties-with-whirlpool-and-will-stop-selling-its-appliances.html)

It has been grappling with a pension of roughly 100,000 retirees that, as of January 2018, was underfunded by $1.5 billion, according FactSet.

It became a guessing game among analysts and onlookers whether each of Sears' last five holiday seasons would be its last. But Lampert kept surprising them, extending a lifeline in the form of loans from his hedge fund ESL Investments, or finding them elsewhere, each time bankruptcy looked inevitable.

Lampert, though, sounded the alarm in a Sept. 13 [blog post](https://blog.searsholdings.com/eddie-lampert/update-on-our-transformation/). He pleaded for Sears' creditor's to agree to restructure, calling out the risks should they drag their feet.

""We continue to believe that it is in the best interests of all our stakeholders to accomplish this as a going concern, rather than alternatives that could result in significant reductions in value,"" he wrote.

By early October, it became evident that Sears' last Christmas before bankruptcy had already passed. Sears began to [raise emergency financing to support the business through coming filing](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/10/sears-arranges-financing-for-a-potential-bankruptcy.html).

Now, the question will be whether Sears will be able to come out of bankruptcy. [Retailers don't have a great track record of emerging](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/here-are-the-retailers-that-have-filed-for-bankruptcy-so-far-this-year.html). Several of late, like Toys R Us and department store Bon-Ton, have been forced to liquidate. It is difficult to make changes needed, like investing in e-commerce, stores and a company's brand, while still catering to creditors' demands.",2018-10-15 16:24:34
189,My experience of the 2008 bailout,3594,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fp4vxy/my_experience_of_the_2008_bailout/,583,"I wanted to share my experience of the 2008 bailouts because we are among friends. Right? And friends help each others, and share their experiences. Right?


During the financial crisis of 2008, it became clear that the government had to step in. People were losing their jobs, stock market dropped by more than 30%, the market was going up and down by 5-10% a day (the amount my brokerage accounts would go up or down was more than what I was earning in a month at work). It was humbling.


It was really tough and difficult to trade. Buy on the down days? Sell on the up days? Hold it until sky clears, despite having bled a lot of money already? I was over leveraged too (through LEAP options), which was not the smartest thing to do at the time, but heh, are you going to lock the loss?


Then came the bailout, with a lot of volatility leading to it. A lot of back and forth for days for politicians to get a chance to pass it. (They may have failed to pass the first version even, I don't remember).


Finally, one of the branch passes it, and it's time for the other branch to pass it. ""About time, after the bailout, things are going to get better, we can save those companies, we can move ahead and blue sky is coming.""


I remember at the time, I was looking at the final votes, and I could not believe it. As the votes would come in, and it became clear that the bailout would pass, S&P futures started to drop, like a stone. WTF!!! Help is coming, everything will get better, why is it dropping?


Well, the reason is simple, by signing the bailout, politicians agreed that we were in a shitty situation, companies needed to be saved, and the lousy bailout was getting signed, and there was no more good news down the line for a while. We shot our ammos, and now let's pray. So it became sell the news.


As the market continued dropping days after days, and I was going to be wiped out, I had to sell to not be over leveraged anymore. I had to take a 6 figures loss. And I am fortunate that I sold, because the market continued to significantly tank for almost 6 more months to level I did not think we would reach. After selling, I was not taking as much risk anymore, I got burned hard.


After we reached the bottom, I switched my positions to risky assets, and I was able to make up some of the losses. But that was a great learning experience, and I figured that I preferred to learn that lesson at the time, when my accounts were not too big than later. Recovering from a 6 figures loss is doable, but more than that, and it is a decade or more of setback.


Well, I can say that almost 12 years later (fuck, already!), the situation is very similar.
This time, I was ready, and maybe that will be another post to explain what I did in 2019-2020, as it can be easily applied.


So today:

- People were losing their jobs. Check.

- Stock market dropped by more than 30%. Check.

- The market was going up and down by 5-10% a day. Check.

- Bailout in the process, taking days to agree on. Check.


I am not saying that the market is going to drop after the bailout is voted, but watch out for that.
Unlike 2008, there is no blue sky coming. The bailout is only a short term fix. How long do you think $1200 per person is going to last?


Unlike 2008, we know that the worst is ahead of us. We still don't know. In the US, the coronavirus pandemic is expected to peak in at least 2-3 weeks. But who knows?
As we are doubling every 2-3 days, it could mean 100 times more new cases per day. 100 times more death per day (few weeks later the infection). It's absolutely a staggering and awful number.
Hopefully, lockdown will be enforced in every state, so we can reduce this grow rate.
Hospitals are already over capacity, nobody can tell exactly how this is going to end (except that's going to be a carnage).
Esp. as some are talking about removing the lockdown in 2 weeks!
And even after the peak, it means that people are still getting sick, people are still dying, as they are hospitalized for 2-4 weeks.
Expect at least 1-2 months of pain, even after peak.


I understand that the market is forward looking, but there are still many opportunities for false head starts, and failed bounces from the bottom.


From my experience with the 2008 bailout, nobody could really predict the bottom. Even as it was a financial crisis.
This time, it is not looking pretty, so please don't be like the 2008-me, don't be over-leveraged (yet), things can go either way. Politicians are very good at messing up a crisis.


And most of all, be safe and healthy, stay home as much as you can. It is going to be a rough ride, and unfortunately we are only getting started.
My sincere thoughts for people with friends and families that are going through hardship, sickness and death.
Hang in there!

Edit: Thank you for the feedback, comments and kind words. Much appreciated. Stay safe!",2020-03-26 15:04:08

""But while demand returns to normal, it will be from a base with less business travel. “Before we used to have these internal meetings and things of that nature, and I think this is going to be way more Zoom-oriented, other types of substitutes,” he said. “Look at the routes that the airlines are planning when they come back, they’re not going to be at the same level that they were previously.”",2020-05-08 03:52:13

People are comparing them to pets.com, but I don’t think even that company was this blatant at ripping investors off. Their “quarterly report” might as well have been a fat middle finger to both their investors and the SEC.

Oh btw the company is worth around $15B... and some analysts are saying it’s a “buying opportunity” given today’s dip.

**Edit**: for more context on the Pets.com comparison:

Pets.com had annual revenue of $619k for first year, and reached a market cap of $400M at its highest. Crazy bubble right?

Well Nikola has annual revenue of less than $100k (maybe a bit more depends on how many more solar panels the CEO is gonna order for his houses lmao), but reached market cap of $30B at its highest.

It’s literally 500 times more overvalued than the most infamous bubble stock during the dotcom crisis.

**Edit 2**: For the people who argue how revenue doesn't matter because they are the next Tesla.

For comparison. Tesla was founded in 2003 and 5 years later the original Tesla Roadster was on sale. They didn't go IPO until 2 years after that. Elon Musk also had a decent track record, being a co-founder and CEO of this small startup called PayPal.

Meanwhile Nikola Motors was founded in 2004, by a businessman with no real education whose resume is ""fluffy"" at best, and their six years of ""industry leading product development"" has yielded some fantastic CG renderings. 

Can Nikola be the next Tesla? Never say never, especially in the year 2020. But my bet is that Trevor Milton is closer to Elizabeth Holmes than Elon Musk.

**Edit 3** Ahahahaha apparently Trevor gave out more update of their factory construction (remember production is supposed to start in 2021) at yesterday's quarterly call...and drum roll......

194,Reminder: BABA stock does NOT entitle shareholders to equity in Alibaba,3402,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kjgtuc/reminder_baba_stock_does_not_entitle_shareholders/,756,"Been seeing a lot of users posting DD on Alibaba and making a bullish case for it. Seems like the massive drop in share price now should be a fantastic opportunity to pick up the Amazon of China at only a forward P/E of 18 right? Not exactly.

This has been posted before in less detail, but I think it's important to remind investors of the current circumstances arising during the anti-trust probe with China.

The reason why BABA is nose-diving on any extra news of government involvement is that BABA represents ownership of a shell company in the cayman islands, not actually Alibaba itself. The shell company doesn't even have ownership of Alibaba's equity. If you want proof of this, simply open up any of their financial statements filed with the SEC.

Chinese law forbids foreigners from owning strategic assets in the country, and Alibaba wouldn’t be able to keep its licenses if, say, a U.S. hedge fund directly bought into the company.  Basically, the Alibaba stock will buy you a stake in a Cayman Islands-registered entity that is under contract to receive the profit from Alibaba's Chinese assets but will not actually own them. This structure is called a VIE.

So think about this, if Chinese laws prohibit foreigners from owning/investing in these kinds of assets in China, what would protect the shell company in the Caymans from enforcing their contract to receive profits from Alibaba if shit hit the fan with the CCP? If Alibaba gets broken up during anti-trust probes, how do we know which subsidiaries BABA ( the shell company in the caymans) will be contractually obligated to receive profits from? Heck, is this contract to receive profits even enforceable in China, where the law clearly states foreigners can't own strategic investments?

Is this VIE structure even legal in China? Beijing has never acknowledged the legality. According to Harris Bricken, an international law firm:

"" VIEs are illegal. We disagree with those who are saying that what is proposed is a two tier, foreign/Chinese system. ""

We don't know the true answers to the above questions. BABA could easily be worth 0$ if investors one day decide that the ""contract"" to receive profits from Alibaba is basically BS.

Alibaba and Chinese executives come out a winner either way. Alibaba was able to raise billions from foreign investors without giving up a single bit of ownership.

Oh, by the way, all Chinese listed companies on US exchanges are listed as Cayman shell companies, this isn't specific to Alibaba. Baidu and JD are set up the same way.

EDITS:

1. Since many of you are asking, yes NIO is also set up this way. When I said all Chinese companies are listed this way, I literally mean 100%.
2. I don't know why so many high-profile investors still buy these ADR's. My favourite value investor, Bill Miller, also holds a huge position in BABA. I guess you're either in the camp that believes China won't enforce their own laws on foreign ownership so BABA's VIE is undervalued, or that one day they will and so the intrinsic value of BABA's VIE is 0$ because profits can never legally flow to foreign investors.
3. The SEC just last month in a report published in November expressed serious concerns: ""These China-based Issuer VIE structures pose risks to U.S. investors that are not present in other organizational structures. For example, exerting control through contractual arrangements may be less effective than direct equity ownership, and a company may incur substantial costs to enforce the terms of the arrangements, including those relating to the distribution of funds among the entities. Further, the Chinese government could determine that the agreements establishing the VIE structure do not comply with Chinese law and regulations, including those related to restrictions on foreign ownership, which could subject a China-based Issuer to penalties, revocation of business and operating licenses, or forfeiture of ownership interests. "" Source: [https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/disclosure-considerations-china-based-issuers](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/disclosure-considerations-china-based-issuers)

2. Got a job as a Phlebotomist and made around $12-$14 an hour from say age 28-33 and continued to contribute around 5%
3. After about 7 years of this at age 33 my balance was maybe around $20,000 or so (kind of disappointing)
4. Age 34 graduated college and got first real job as a medical technologist making $24.50 an hour and bumped 403b up to 10%
5. Age 37 making about $27 an hour as Medical Technologist and bumped it up to 15% contribution limit.
6. Age 39 making $29 an hour and 15% contribution I finally hit the $100,000 mark in my 403b account. It took me a good 12-13 years of saving.
7. I am now age 41 and first year I moved to San Diego and am going to earn low six figures this year. I have bumped 403b up to max $19,000 per year.
8. Age 41.5; My liquid assets are now at $267,000. (around $50,000 of that from selling real estate)

I am shocked at how fast the ball gets rolling once you hit that first $100,000 balance in your 401k/403b. I took forever to reach that milestone but once i got there I probably made most of the second 100K in about 2 years compounding interest. I think it sets something off inside of you where you see that your money can make you more in one great stock market day then you earn at your 9-5 job in a 2 week pay period. That is when you really see the value of saving and investing and you normally try to max your contributions at this point no matter the discomfort in doing so. I could only imagine how fast wealth starts to snowball once you reach $1,000,000 and a good 2019 stock market year could add $250,000 to your portfolio. (more then most middle class workers earn in 5 years of work)

My 2 questions for this post are did anyone else notice that once you hit $100K liquid assets it seems like its kind of the sweet spot where your wealth snowball really starts rolling.

Secondly, why do so many people who focus so hard on earning money at their job, totally ignore saving and investing where undeniably once you reach a certain point your money will begin to go to work everyday, earning as much as a Physician, and start earning you a second six figure income passively.

Its almost as if the number one secret to financial life is to get to 100K then 1,000,000 as quick as humanly possible and then coast the rest of your life one easy mode.

Its true the rich get richer....But it takes a ton of discomfort and sacrifice to reach that point....The first 100K is the hardest.",2020-08-22 22:35:45

In almost every interview he's asked why is he stacking cash or why Berkshire isn't outperforming the S&P 500. The majority of questions aren't as brazen, but rewatch some of his interviews and you'll see that 1 or 2 questions along those lines comes up. 

Take this article by CNBC from November of last year:

*Being in the enviable position of having that much cash to spend seems unenviable at the moment, as far as Berkshire shareholders, and maybe even Buffett, are concerned. Buffett’s company is currently on pace for its worst annual stock performance since 2009.*

*“He pinned himself into a corner a few years ago, saying I can’t have $150 billion in cash in three to four years and say that’s alright,” said Greggory Warren, a Morningstar analyst who covers Berkshire Hathaway.*

*Underperformance versus the index, deals that have not worked out well, such as Kraft Heinz (thought it showed signs of life in its most recent earnings), and increasing willingness on Buffett’s part to consider share buybacks, all point to the the importance of moving that cash into investments that generate a return.""*

https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/even-obvious-way-for-buffett-to-solve-big-cash-problem-is-a-puzzle.html

I can spend all day finding each and every article from the past 2-3 years but you understand my point. 

As stocks soared to all time highs, people wondered just as they did during the tech boom whether Buffett had lost his touch. Now Buffett is sitting on a 125+ Billion dollar mountain of cash just biding his time. He's poised more favorably than he could ever ask for, and prices are just getting more reasonable by the day.

TLDR: When you see Buffett stacking cash, he's not an idiot. He's waiting for prices to become reasonable again, which only happens after a significant market decline.

I wanted to chat a bit about options here. I realize that there are already plenty of articles about options that you can find online, but many are either overly complex, oversimplified, trying to sell you some products, etc. I figured I would explain some of it here, in order to reduce the learning barrier. After all, knowledge is power. And given the **recent** [event](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/young-robinhood-trader-kills-himself-over-730000-loss) **with Robinhood**, I figured it is worth repeating how options work so you understand what is happening under the hood, and don’t end up taking too many risks and making mistakes that you could regret later. If you are interested in trading options, I invite you to look for more details online.

I have been trading options since 2008. I made some mistakes, so many, especially in the beginning. Over the years, I kinda reduced my option trading activities, but these past few months, I have been doing it much more as there are so many opportunities and the market is so volatile, which helps with my trading style.

This **first** post is to explain how options work in general, the [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hdg9xc/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_2_of_4/) post will go into some more details, the third posts [3a](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hgomwv/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_3a_of_4/) and [3b](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hgp05y/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_3b_of_4/) will explain some standard strategies, and the fourth posts ([4a](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hlb9ns/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_4a_of_4/) and [4b](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hu8uh9/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_last_post_part/)) will give some examples for my recent trades with gains and losses and how I approach option investing. If you are looking at r/wsb style of investment, please skip these posts, they are not for you. I am a relatively conservative investor and will avoid pure gambles, but I will still take some calculated risks. So I say. :) It is fair to say that most of my money is invested in standard ETFs / mutual funds / Real Estate. So, my option play represents only a percentage of my overall wealth.

It is often perceived that options are extremely risky, and one of the best ways to get ruined. For some trades, this can be true. To dispel a myth, in reality, options can also be used to be extremely conservative. Even to a point where you barely make any money at all in any market. Unlike for shares, where you can only control the diversification, with options you have a much bigger control on the risk / profit profile. Time and volatility is also a factor that you can profit (or lose) from.

One thing to note is that not all companies or ETFs provide options for their shares.

**The basics: CALL and PUT contracts, strike, and exercise**

Options are split into two groups: CALLs and PUTs. Both have a strike, an expiration date, and a number of shares attached to it. We’ll talk about the exercise and expiration date a bit later. When you buy a call or put option, you buy a contract with a 3rd party through your broker and the stock market. Usually, one contract represents 100 shares.

The strike corresponds to a share price for the underlying instrument. So for SPY that is worth $308 today, you will have options with strike $308, but also $300, $301, $310, etc… From $5 to $525. Options strikes are created as the underlying instrument SPY goes up and down. For SPY, strikes have a granularity of $1 around the share price, but can also be $5 or even $10 farther from the current price. Some other instruments have a $2.5, $5 or even $10 granularity. It can even have a $0.50 granularity. (Hello Hertz! It dropped so much that the lowest strike is $0.50 right now).

A CALL is a contract that allows the buyer to buy a number of shares at a given strike price before an expiration date. If you buy a call with a $150 strike, and the share price went up to reach $200, this allows you to buy some shares at $150 that are now worth $200. The action of exchanging your call against some shares that you bought at the strike price is called exercising the call. When you exercise your call contract, you are buying shares into your account.

Remember that, in most cases, 1 contract will buy 100 shares in your account. When exercising each call contract, you will need $15k of cash in your account in this example ($150 for the strike, multiplied by 100 shares). And the same 100 shares are now worth $20k (at $200 for each share). Not accounting for the price you paid for the call option (more on this later), this means you will make a profit of $5k if you sell the shares.

Conversely, a PUT is a contract that allows the buyer to sell a number of shares at a given strike price before an expiration date. If you bought a put with a $200 strike, and the share price went down to $150, this allows you to sell some shares at $200 that are now worth $150 each. Similarly to a call, the action of exchanging your put against some shares that you sold is called exercising the put.

When exercising each put contract, you are selling 100 shares from your account. When exercising each contract, your 100 shares will be sold for $20k ($200 for the strike multiplied by 100 shares). And the same 100 shares are now worth $15k (at $150 for each share). Not accounting for the price you paid for the put option, this means you made a profit of $5k. If you did not have the 100 shares per contract in your account, you would be actually short selling the shares, and you could make the $5k profit by buying these shares back.

In summary, a call buys shares when exercising. A put sells shares when exercising. Most importantly, in the vast majority of the cases, you should actually not exercise your contracts, but instead, you should sell your call or put at the market price, as you will increase your profit (see extrinsic value later).

Brokers do not allow you to exercise the contract if the difference between the strike and the current value is going to make you lose money. In other words, you can’t exercise when the current value is below the strike for a call (you want to buy low when the value is high), or current value is above the strike for a put (you want to sell high when the value is low).

Most brokers do auto-exercise your call and put contracts at the expiration date if they can be exercised. If the contracts cannot be exercised at the expiration date, and you did not sell your contracts before, they will be worthless, and the money you spent buying the contracts will be completely lost.

Although I am mostly talking about American style options that can be exercised at any time, there are also European style options that can only be exercised at expiration. In the US markets, pretty much all stocks and ETFs are American style, But the cash-settled indexes, like SPX and RUT, are European style.

**The basics: Intrinsic and extrinsic value**

A call or a put contract costs money to buy, called a premium, so a 3rd party can give you the right to exercise the call or the put. After all, they won’t take the other side of this contract for free, and they have to be remunerated. The minimum for a contract is $0.01 per share for some very liquid ETFs, but for most instruments, it is $0.05, thus $5 per contract for 100 shares. When you buy a call or put, this premium is the most you can lose by expiration date. The 3rd party that sold the contract to you is open to many more risks and potential losses (see below).

The value of the call and put contracts will depend on the strike, on the share price going up and down, the share’s volatility (how fast / far it goes up or down), and the time passing.

When you buy a contract, the strike and the expiration date is known. However, the share price and volatility will constantly change. All the call and put options are constantly repriced as time is also passing (closer to the expiration date).

The intrinsic value is the portion of the contract value that only depends on the strike and the current share price. It is above $0 only when you can exercise the contract. The extrinsic value is the portion of the contract value that depends on the volatility and time. For pretty much all options, this extrinsic value is above $0, and will slowly drop to $0 as we get closer to the expiration.

Let’s take an example with a share price of $150.

Say, you buy a call with a strike of $145 expiring in a month for $7. The intrinsic value is $5 ($150 - $145), the extrinsic value is $2 ($7 - $5). Said differently, if the share price did not move at all until the expiration date, your call contract would bring you $5 per share. You would have lost $2 due to the time passing.

Similarly, you buy a put with a strike of $155 expiring in a month for $7. The intrinsic value is $5 ($155 - $150), the extrinsic value is $2 ($7 - $5).

It is worth noting that any call with a strike price at $150 or above has $0 of intrinsic value. If you pay $4 for a $155 call, all the $4 is extrinsic value. If the stock price does not go over $155, you will lose the full $4 per share (so a $400 loss per contract). Similarly, a put with a strike price at $150 or below has $0 of intrinsic value. If you pay $4 for a $145 call, all the $4 is extrinsic value. Your contract will be worthless by expiration if the stock price did not drop under $145.

Note that, in these examples, I use the same price for the call and put options that are $5 away from the strike price, but it’s not always the case. The call and price options are priced differently depending on the volatility, market expectations, potential dividends, cost of money, etc.

**The basics: ATM, ITM, and OTM**

There are few definitions related to the relationship between the strike and the current share value for puts and calls.

An option is ‘At The Money’ (ATM) when the current share value is matching the strike. The share price is $150, and the strike of $150 for both the call and put contracts will be considered ‘at the money’.

An option is ‘In The Money’ (ITM) when the contract has some intrinsic value. The share price is $150, so a call at $140 is ‘in the money’, with $10 of intrinsic value. A put at $160 is ‘in the money’, with $10 of intrinsic value too.

An option is ‘deep in the money’ when the option is ITM and the strike is far from the current share price (for example more than 20%). For example, with a share price of $150, a $100 call will be considered ‘deep in the money’. Same for a $200 put.

Conversely, an option is ‘out of the money’ if there is no intrinsic value. With a $150 share price, a $160 call is ‘out of the money’. A $140 put is ‘out of the money’. The money you paid for the call and put is purely extrinsic value, there is no intrinsic value. An option is ‘deep out of the money’ when the option is OTM and the strike is far from the current share price. For example, with a share price of $150, a $200 call will be considered ‘deep out of the money’. Same for a $100 put.

As the share price goes up and down, depending on the option strikes, it can switch between ITM, to ATM, to OTM. The option price will always reflect that and will be based on the time at expiration and the current share volatility.

Few key things to note:

* The deeper ITM an option is, the more expensive it is. As it gets deeper ITM, the intrinsic value increases, the extrinsic value decreases. You have a higher chance for the option to be worth something, and you will lose less money on the extrinsic value. The price of Deep ITM options will move very closely to the underlying shares (a positive correlation for calls, a negative correlation for puts).
* The deeper OTM an option is, the less expensive it is. Again, OTM option price is pure extrinsic value. You have a very small chance for the option to be worth something by expiration.
* The maximum extrinsic value is when the option is ATM. It is purely extrinsic value, with barely any intrinsic value. These option strikes are the most sensitive to time, volatility and share price.

Here is an example, with the same share price of $150. For a call, you could get something like this:

Strike = $100 / Premium = $53 / Intrinsic = $50 / Extrinsic = $3 ← Deep ITM

Strike = $125 / Premium = $30 / Intrinsic = $25 / Extrinsic = $5 ← ITM

Strike = $150 / Premium = $9   / Intrinsic = $0   / Extrinsic = $9 ← ATM

Strike = $175 / Premium = $5   / Intrinsic = $0   / Extrinsic = $5 ← OTM

Strike = $200 / Premium = $3   / Intrinsic = $0   / Extrinsic = $3 ← Deep OTM

You can imagine the same table for a put but in the other direction.

It is worth noting that if you have a $100 call and you decide to exercise it, you would directly get $50 of proceeds per share, but you would also destroy the extrinsic value to $0, losing $3 of proceeds. Instead of exercising your call, you are much better off selling your call for $53. In general, there are not many reasons to exercise your options. Selling them is more advantageous.

> Elon Musk tweeted a complaint about Tesla’s share price that wiped $14bn off the company’s stock market value on Friday morning.

	Tesla did not immediately confirm whether Mr Musk’s tweet had been given legal clearance, and did not respond to a question about whether the company currently has a general counsel. Tesla lost three general counsels last year, one of them quitting after only two months.


	The Tesla boss, who has 33m followers on Twitter, issued his curt verdict on his company’s shares early in the morning in California on Friday, writing: “Tesla stock price is too high imo.”

Within moments the Tesla share price started sinking, dropping 10 per cent over the course of an hour before recovering slightly. The sharp move comes in what has been a hugely volatile period for Tesla’s shares. They slumped more than 60 per cent after coronavirus hit, but then rebounded by 120 per cent.

215,Reasons We May Not Be in a Bubble,3025,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpeffw/reasons_we_may_not_be_in_a_bubble/,913,"I'm seeing a lot of posts comparing this to the 2000 dot-com bubble. Here's a breakdown of why we're likely not anywhere close to 2000 levels of craziness.

**First:**  During the dot-com era, the Nasdaq Composite's price-to-earnings valuation ran up as high as 200. By comparison, the index's P/E today is a relatively tame 28, only modestly higher from 23 at the end of 2019. 

**Second:** Interest rates were a very attractive 6% which provided a strong alternative to stocks. No such outlet exists today unless you trust bitcoin, or want to invest in paper gold.

**Third:** Much of the value gains we're seeing in the market can be tied directly to the fact that people who invest are making similar or better money this year, and spending significantly less causing them to save more and invest more:

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html)

**Fourth:** The rest of the growth can largely be attributed to increased liquidity from all of the money printing. Stocks tend to mirror an increase in the money supply with their value making them a great hedge against inflation. The valuations of the 2000s weren't backstopped by QE or increased savings, making them much shakier.

**Fifth:** The money printing will likely go on for a while. People mistakenly assume we're printing against our 22T dollar economy when we're really printing against the 80-100T global economy for which are the reserve currency. A weak dollar benefits the global economy, and benefits us because we are the trading floor for the global economy.

This is a long but very illuminating read on why QE is necessary and actually helpful:

[https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/](https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/)

**My Take:** There are a few stocks that are out of control with their valuations (Hi TSLA!), and a few sectors that are overvalued, but overall the market looks to be on sturdy ground with the increased savings, and the increased liquidity. There will be peaks and valleys, but I think there's a lot of room to grow, especially once the vaccine is widespread.",2021-01-03 16:19:22

However, the EV executive gets to walk away with more than $3.1 billion in stock as part of a separation agreement reached over the weekend.

Milton, who’s come under scrutiny in recent days, agreed to give up his position and duties as executive chairman of the board as well as all other board seats on the company’s subsidiaries, according to the agreement dated Sunday. The deal strips the 39-year old entrepreneur of any say in the company’s operations and blocks him from attempting to influence any decisions for at least three years, according to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. Milton agreed to advise the company as an unpaid consultant on an ad hoc basis through the end of the year, but he cannot comment about the company on social media, blogs or other online platforms without legal approval from Nikola, according to the deal.

The value of his exit package will vary over time as the start-up’s shares have swung wildly since it went public on June 4. The agreement requires Milton to give up roughly 4.9 million in restricted, performance-based shares valued at $166 million as of Friday’s closing price of $34.19 a share while allowing him to walk away with more than 91.6 million shares that were worth over $3.1 billion.

Nikola declined to comment on Milton’s exit package.

‘Continued service’

The company also accelerated vesting on 600,000 restricted shares worth more than $20 million, allowing Milton to sell stock that was previously locked up until June 3, 2023 sometime within then next six months. Milton really didn’t give up much since the restricted shares he forfeited were contingent on the stock’s performance and his “continued service” at the company through that same date, so he would have lost that equity regardless, according to a separate securities filing.

Milton’s resignation sent shares of the company plummeting in premarket trading before opening at $24.97 – their lowest opening price since the company went public. Shares were trading down about 20% during trading midday Monday.

&#x200B;

For investors worried about how the election will impact their portfolios over the long haul, fear not: Elections have seldom had a lasting impact on equity prices.

President Donald Trump has warned that the stock market will crash if former Vice President Joe Biden wins the [presidential election](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/election-2020-live-results-updates-trump-biden.html). Some market experts have also raised concern about the potential for a “blue wave” if Democrats gain a majority in the Senate, win the White House and keep control of the House.

However, history shows that stocks usually do well regardless of which party controls the White House or Congress. 

“I think people overestimate the importance of politics for investing,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. 

### Are Republicans or Democrats better for stocks? 

Data over the past 78 years shows that party control over either chamber has relatively little to do with long-term changes in the broad S&P 500 stock index.

Starting in 1942, the numbers indicate that Republican and Democratic majorities in the House and Senate have had little impact on stock prices in the two years following an election. 

The same holds true when you look at the number of party seats gained or lost in the House and Senate, against stock prices in the S&P 500 during that period. 

The data yields similar results for the November to November cycle, which is a gauge of market sentiment to the election, as well as January to January, which shows the actual market performance of the Congress. 

### Presidents and stocks 

Where you start to see more of an impact is the combination of party control in both chambers of Congress. 

Data compiled by LPL Financial shows that beginning in 1950, the average annual stock return was 17.2% under a split Congress, 13.4% when Republicans held both chambers, and 10.7% when Democrats had control.

LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick said in a note that “markets tend to like checks and balances to make sure one party doesn’t have too much sway,” hence the stronger stock performance during a split Congress.

But when you broaden it out even further to consider the party of the president in tandem with party control of the two chambers, the trend of a split Congress being best for stocks doesn’t always hold true. 

Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, looked at how the market has performed under six political scenarios: a White House and Congress all under the same party, a White House with a split Congress, and a White House and Congress hailing from two different parties. Stovall included election data going back to 1945.

Of all the possible combinations, stocks appear to perform best when a Democrat is in the White House and the Congress is split. The second highest returns happen when a Democrat is president and Republicans control the Congress.

 

But ultimately, Stovall said, investors should be wary of reading too much into these numbers. 

“It’s a good example of how you can have data tell whatever story you want,” he said. “If you want to favor the Democrats, talk about the presidency. If you want to favor the Republicans, talk about House control.“  


Bob French, director of investment analysis at McLean Asset Management, agrees. “We can go in and slice and dice the data however we want and most of the time come up with whatever answer we want.”

However the vote plays out Tuesday, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee thinks the stock market is poised to take off.

“At least 90% of \[our\] portfolio strategy would be identical under either win,” Lee said in a note on Oct. 6. In either case, Lee predicts the outcome of the election will be bullish for stocks.",2020-11-04 04:45:13

Millions of people are behind on their credit-card and auto-loan payments, the latest sign of the coronavirus pandemic’s financial devastation.

Lenders in April had nearly 15 million credit cards in “financial hardship” programs, such as deferral programs that let borrowers temporarily stop making payments, according to estimates by credit-reporting firm TransUnion. That accounts for about 3% of the credit-card accounts the company tracks, TransUnion said Wednesday.

Nearly three million auto loans were in these hardship programs, accounting for about 3.5% of those tracked.

The numbers have surged from a year ago, when 0.03% of credit cards and about 0.5% of auto loans were in financial-hardship programs.

The spike in unemployment caused by the coronavirus has strained people’s ability to make their monthly debt payments. To make matters worse, Americans were tapping credit cards and auto loans at record levels even before the pandemic to deal with rising costs and stagnant incomes.

As coronavirus cases surged in the U.S. and businesses shut down, millions of people told their lenders they wouldn’t be able to pay their bills. Some lenders have allowed borrowers to miss payments for as long as several months on credit cards, auto loans and personal loans.

The performance award consists of a 10-year grant of stock options  that vests in 12 tranches. Each of the 12 tranches vests only if a pair  of milestones are both met.

* Market Cap Milestones: To meet the first market cap milestone, Tesla's current market cap must increase to $100 billion. For each of the remaining 11 milestones, Tesla's market cap must continue to increase in additional $50 billion increments. Thus, for Elon to fully vest in the award, Tesla's market cap must increase to $650 billion.
* Operational Milestones: To meet the operational milestones, Tesla  must meet a set of escalating Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA targets (the  only adjustment to EBITDA is for stock-based compensation). These  milestones are even more directly aligned with shareholder value  creation than those used in Elon's 2012 performance award. They are  designed to ensure that as Tesla's market cap grows, the company is also  executing well on both a top-line and bottom-line basis.

For each of the 12 tranches that is achieved, Elon will vest in  stock options that correspond to 1% of Tesla's current total outstanding  shares (1% of that amount is approximately 1.69 million shares). If  none of the 12 tranches is achieved, Elon will not receive any  compensation.

To give some perspective:

* 50 years old

* Graduated from a no-name college with a business degree (paid my own way, had about $20,000 in student loans when I graduated)

* First year out of college made $21,000.  Was at $58,000 when I was 29.  Highest year was about $125,000, but have averaged around $100,000 for the past 10 years.

* Pretty much all from putting as much as I could manage, or was permitted, into 401K and IRAs.  About 65% of the total is traditional retirement, 30% ROTH, and 5% non-retirement.

* I bought cheap used cars when I was under 25.  But then bought a new car and drove it for 20 years.

* The only ""bonus"" along the way was I had a job that I got 6 months severance (around $35,000) and got another job right away, so I had ""double income"" for that 6 months.

* 100% self-managed, primarily through an E*Trade account.

* I pretty much buy and just let it sit.  Last time I sold anything was about 3 years ago when I last rebalanced.  I held all through the 2009 recession and lost about 60%.  I've always invested pretty aggressively, so I got hit hard when it went down, but I've recovered well as it's gone up.

* I pretty much focus on mutual funds now after getting my ass handed to me on individual stocks a few times.  The few I have left are ""sentimental"".  The SIRI and MSFT I've owned since 2001.  The FB I bought in the IPO.  BABA was bought shortly after the IPO.

* I opened my first brokerage account with $2,000 in Ameritrade in 1997 thinking I was going to jump on the internet bubble.  I bought and sold weekly and rode that baby down.  I basically never made any money, and when the whole thing crashed, my $2,000 literally got down to like $37.  So many internet stocks that just evaporated.

I am mostly in index funds, although I have positions in several large companies also. I have been around a while, possibly longer than many people here. I was also buying in 2008 when people were freaking out and I have done quite well

2 - Unsubscribe from this sub

Now people are shitting themselves because everything is on sale. I am going to Unsubscribe and try to focus more on my side hustles to generate more cash for buying (see item #1). I am not saying this to be a dick. I am saying it because it is legit unhealthy to freak out and surround yourself with other people that are freaking out.

Take a deep breath. New flu strains surface from time to time, it is very cyclical. Yes, things will get a little worse, but it will rebound and people who buy will be the beneficiaries (don't buy with your rent money obviously,  just be smart). Watch what happens when a vaccine is announced.

Just my two cents. I am going to Unsubscribe now and go for a run. Because good mental & physical health is key.

Some of the paragraphs from the article:

> In the United States, data on the number of Americans filing their first claim for unemployment benefits each week offers a relatively up-to-date reading of the national jobless situation. But in China, jobless indicators are released on a monthly or even quarterly basis, and cover only part of the workforce.

> The most widely cited figure, the surveyed urban unemployment rate issued by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), jumped to an all-time high
of 6.2 per cent in January and February combined, up from 5.2 per cent in December. This roughly equated to an additional 5 million people thrown out of work.

> Another government metric, the urban registered jobless rate, is published quarterly and measures only the urban residents willing to file tedious reams of paperwork to register as being unemployed. This indicator has been stable at a rate of around 4 per cent for years, with few fluctuations over economic cycles.

> Due to the lack of official data covering China’s entire workforce, economists and analysts have started to rely on private surveys, online job listings, anecdotal reports and even indicators such as subway rides in major cities to get a clearer view of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the unemployment situation in China.

> Beijing’s challenge
is particularly severe given the lack of an adequate social safety net in China.

> Unemployment benefits are small and reserved for only a few – a maximum of 2.5 million people claimed unemployment benefits in each quarter over the past decade, in a country of almost 1.4 billion.

> “Rural migrant workers who lost their paid work are generally not included in government data,” Lu said. “Many of them may find it hard to maintain their previous living standards. Many migrant workers will have to go back to their farmland to support a basic lifestyle.”

People asked for more details.

At a high level I have been investing / studying markets since I was very young. I tried everything (internet stocks, FOREX, Options, Futures, small caps etc) coupled with fundamental and technical analysis.  Did OK, even won second place in a trading contest but never got what I wanted.

Like many people I made bad decisions and had divorce, job loss, etc.  Even had to close out an IRA in my twenties.

Ended up turning to a disciplined index fund strategy about 12 years ago. 

Strategy was to max out 401k and live below my means (old car, no cable tv, make my own food, etc).  At the end of each month swept all my pennies into an after tax fund since my 401k was maxed.  That is it.  Make your own coffee and buy VOO or SPY ideally in a tax advantaged account.

I road this through the 2008/2009 crash - kept my investments and bought more.

I also have small (like 5% of my money) in Bitcoin, Tesla and Pot stocks.  This is purely for fun.  

A couple people mentioned this was just luck.  I think it is important to understand the market will move up, retrace, consolidate and then move higher.  The timing of this is somewhat luck.  The strategy part is live below your means, buy and accumulate positions for years so when a bull market hits you are in.  I guess you can call each runup ""luck"" except people keep living in debt no matter what their income.  I would much prefer people take away an investment strategy that does work if you are a disciplined from someone not born rich and who tried a lot of different strategies.

The takeaway really is with education and discipline you can reach a level of financial independence even after many screwups.  I can publish this simple system and honestly few will follow it...  There are no ads, systems to buy or affiliate links. I make zero dollars sharing this.  I make my own coffee and watch netflix.  I invest the rest in index funds.  Take a trip or buy something if it really is important to me.  That is it.

I wrote it out as a little story with fictitious characters to make it a little less boring.


#Five way to time your IRA contribution

Steve, Mike, Larry, Tom and Paul were college friends who graduated 40 years ago. On they day they graduated, they made a pact to max out their IRAs every year, starting in 1979. (It was a Traditional IRA back then as the Roth wasn’t introduced until 1997).

&nbsp;

They continued contributing every year for 40 years from 1979-2018. Every year they maxed out their IRAs as allowed by the IRS. Over the years the IRS has changed that contribution limit as follows:

 * 1979-1981: $1,500
 * 1982-2000: $2,000
 * 2002-2004: $3,000
 * 2005-2007: $4,000
 * 2008-2012: $5,000
 * 2013-2018: $5,500

Maxing out their IRAs for those 40 years, each of the friends contributes a grand total of **$123,500** in cash.

#Save or Invest?

Steve had heard that the stock market was risky, so he decided to never actually invest his money and instead left it in a money market account inside of his IRA. The other four were ahead of their time and knew the power of buying and holding index funds. They all decided to invest 100% of their contributions in a single S&P 500 index fund and never sell. But each had a different strategy about when to make the contribution and investment. Let’s see how they fared.

#Steady Saving Steve

Steve hated the thought of losing his retirement money and heard the stock market was risky. So every every month for forty years he would contribute 1/12th of the maximum allowable IRA contribution to his IRA and leave it invested in a money market account. (Basically an interest paying cash account). His account earned interest, which was a bit of a wild ride over the years since the interest rates were over 17% (wow!) for many months in the early 80s, but under 1% from 2009 through 2018. With his slow and steady saving and consistent interest, Steve’s nest egg never went down in value and grew to **$210,557** by the end of 2018.

#Monthly Maintenance Mike

Mike also contributed money once per month in equal amounts of 1/12th of the annual contribution limit. But instead of leaving it in a money market account, Mike always invested it in an S&P 500 index fund. He left it alone and never sold anything. His monthly strategy grew his investment to **$1,045,129** at the end of 2018, beating Steady Saving Steve by 396%.

#Lump Sum Larry
Larry didn’t like waiting or making monthly transactions. So on the first day the market was open each year, Larry maxed out his IRA and invested it in his S&P 500 index fund in a single lump sum. His lump sum strategy grew his IRA to **$1,109,386** at the end of 2018, beating Monthly Mike by 6.1%.

#Terrible Timing Tom

Tom also dumped all his money in at once each year, but he had the worst timing possible. Instead of buying a little each month or buying all at the beginning of the year, Tom invested the moment of the absolute peak of the market each year. For example. in 1987, he dumped all his money at the peak, right before Black Monday only to watch the value of his IRA drop by more than a third over the following few months. But he never sold, and stuck to his terrible timing for 40 years. His strategy netted him **$919,533** at the end, about 12% less than Monthly Mike made.

#Perfectly Precise Paul

Paul also dumped all his money in at once. But Paul was omniscient. He was only person on the planet that pinpointed the exact instant of the market low 40 consecutive years. And at that instant he optimized the potential value of his IRA by dumping every penny of the annual max contribution and happily watched it go up for the remainder of the year. Paul’s impossibly perfect precision earned him the most of any of the five friends: **$1,212,838**. Even with his ability to see the market bottom before it happened, he still only beat Lump Sum Larry by 9.3%.

#The Lesson

All four of our index fund buyers handily beat the savings account by well over 4x. They were wise to understand the power of buying and holding an index fund without worrying about the volatility of the market. Terribile Timing Tom and Perfectly Precise Paul showed that even the worst or best possible timing really doesn’t change things all that much. And the realistic strategies that Larry and Mike employed were pretty close, with Lump Sum Larry coming out slightly ahead.

&nbsp;

So if you’ve got the cash, dump it all in on January 1st. If you like the idea of dollar cost averaging, set up auto-investments so it happens every month without having to look at it. But the important thing is to invest early and often! 🙂

255,I lost 25% of my savings this week. Here is what I learned.,2618,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/g7cza6/i_lost_25_of_my_savings_this_week_here_is_what_i/,795,"After a long time of very responsibly trading blue chip stocks for modest gains single digit gains, last week I started contriving a plan to get into oil and ""hit it big"".

I spent at least 40 hours considering all my possible options. Then on Monday afternoon, it became clear to me - **it was time to strike**. I put 50% of my money in.

Tuesday morning was not fun.

Here's what I learned:

* **Don’t ever buy something you don’t FULLY understand.** On Monday, I bought into USO as oil prices bottomed, thinking I was buying into a fund that was purchasing up all of the May Futures contracts. I thought USO was rolling out of April and into May, and they were conveniently buying up all the world’s WTI at bottom of the barrel pricing. I saw the warnings all over the place that people didn’t understand that USO was based on futures, not spot prices. I KNEW USO was buying futures, not spot. I thought that meant I understood the warnings. I didn’t know that the real risk was that I didn’t know which months I was buying into. The funny truth is that they weren’t even making most of their moves on Monday. I was WAY off.
* **Don’t trust third party sources on the details - not even your bank.** Both Yahoo Finance, and my bank - RBC Direct Investing - have incorrect information on USO and most major ETFs. For as long as I have been looking (2 weeks), they've said USO is holding April WTI Futures. This is 100% false: [https://i.imgur.com/bOm0JEQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/bOm0JEQ.png) I thought this meant that USO had to sell all those contracts and move into May contracts on Monday. I thought USO was being paid to take a bunch of oil that they would then have all month to get rid of. But that's not how this works.
* **The word “ETF” is used extremely loosely.** An ETF like SPY or ZQQ.to, is absolutely nothing like all the ETFs out there that are “attempting to track daily movements of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_”. An ""ETF"" is just a fund. Don’t buy into ETFs that you do not FULLY understand. Read the actual prospectus.
* **Do not underestimate the number of stupid investors out there.** As I watched WTI plummet in real time, I immediately saw USO skyrocketing, I thought for sure that meant that smart institutional money was piling into USO. I thought there was no way that retail investors could move a $2.5B fund that fast, but they were. That was not smart money causing the pump. It was a million idiots like me.
* **Don’t fuck around with leveraged ETFs.** In addition to USO, I purchased into a 2X leveraged WTI tracking ETF “HOU.to” at the very end of the day on Monday. I thought for sure on Tuesday morning the oil prices would bounce back up from negative, and give me a big bump. I figured, even if it didn’t work out, I could hold onto it forever until oil comes back. Wrong. You cannot hold onto these things forever. They trend towards 0 mathematically. If you can’t make gains in your first couple of days or weeks, you are probably stuck with taking a loss. You shouldn’t even hold these things more than a single trading day. ESPECIALLY in this crazy market.
* **Despite your Father's advice, you can't just be patient and hold on to everything.** [HOU.to](https://HOU.to) \- which I purchased into - is beyond toast. The company has all but told investors it’s time to cash out. After the fund lost 40% of it’s value on Tuesday, they froze it, and then released an official press release that the ETF was worth about 1/6th of its already obliterated market price. They then said pretty clearly that they no longer expected to be able to achieve the funds objectives. After a few cuss words, I basically kissed my money goodbye. Then much to my pleasant surprise, on Wednesday morning, I saw it was back up for trade. Somehow it was rising. (This goes back to not underestimating the power of stupid money.) I cashed out immediately, and was very pleased to get 2 /3 of my money back. Everyone around me was telling me to be patient and not take a loss. The fund has done nothing but post double digit losses since then, yet millions of people are continuing to trade it, when they should instead be cutting their losses. While June futures are up 70% since Tuesday, this 2x ETF is down like 50% - yet people still cling on.
* **The biggest lesson in these oil ETF’s is that NOTHING is certain in this crazy ass market.** A TON of the pain that I felt this week was caused by USO and other funds like them restructuring. USO has been rolling front month futures on a predictable calendar for 12 years. On Tuesday morning they absolutely fucked my investment in USO, and probably contributed to the obliteration of HOU.to by surprising us all with a restructuring announcement. I never in my life thought that USO was going to restructure. I thought the whole point of it was that they were legally obligated to follow a certain predictable futures trading pattern - and that certainty gave people a mechanism to buy and sell. NOPE. They can legally just do whatever the hell they want, costing retail investors like me an arm and a leg, while their fund managers continue to make 7 figure salaries.
* **Last but certainly not least, this week should be a lesson to us all that there are mammoth sized financial incongruities hidden in every corner of the global economy right now.** The insanity that has taken place in the oil industry this week should be a warning bell to us all. The 2008 crisis was caused by bad assets in a SINGLE industry. Considering the demand for everything is down by at least 30%, and the governments have propped the world up with free cash equivalent to over 10% of global GDP - it’s quite certain that there are “sub prime mortgage backed security” equivalent death traps forming in every single industry. It’s only a matter of time before more of them pop up. They could appear on Monday. They could appear in August. But anyone who is paying attention is fairly certain they are out there.
* **Be careful.**",2020-04-25 04:49:53

Note: proprietary or non-transferable positions may still need to be liquidated, but all publicly traded instruments should be fine.  These transfers typically take 5 business days and you should refrain from transacting on the account when you are ready to transfer. Don’t have open limit orders, expiring options, recurring ACHs open otherwise RH will reject your request. 

Godspeed!!

Edit: I am not a tax advisor so nothing I say should be construed as tax advice, so I cannot tell you what you should or should not do.  Please consult a tax professional if you have specific questions.

Edit #2: Again, I am NOT offering advice to anyone. This post should not be interpreted as me telling you to transfer your account. That decision is fully YOURS to make. 

Edit #3: I kind of touched on this, but an ACATS transfer will lock your account for the duration of the transfer, preventing you from trading. You need to be ok with not trading for ~5 business days (this can take longer depending on how long it takes the broker to review) so be cognizant of that given the market’s recent volatility.",2020-03-05 13:06:23

While answering analysts’ questions about liquidity amid the coronavirus pandemic, Musk called shelter-in-place orders “forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights.”


Musk said he was concerned about not being able to resume operations at the company’s factory in Fremont, California, saying that possibility should be considered “a serious risk” given Tesla produces most of its cars there in addition to its Shanghai-based plant. Tesla had initially said the factory it would remain open despite shelter-in -lace orders until the county where it’s located said it could not be considered an essential business. Six counties, including Alameda, where Tesla’s factory is located, recently extended their shelter-in-place orders through the end of May. 

Musk had spoken out about government restrictions on citizens during the coronavirus pandemic earlier on Twitter, but further expressed his opinion on Wednesday’s call while encouraging government officials to invest in infrastructure. He praised China for having “much better” infrastructure than the U.S.

“This is the time to think about the future, and also to ask, is it right to infringe upon people’s rights as what is happening right now?” Musk said.

“I think the people are going to be very angry about this and are very angry. It’s like somebody should be, if somebody wants to stay in the house that’s great, they should be allowed to stay in the house and they should not be compelled to leave. But to say that they cannot leave their house, and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist. This is not democratic. This is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom.”

At another point on the call, he said, “So the expansion of the shelter in place or as we call it forcibly imprisoning people in their homes, against all their constitutional rights, is my opinion, and breaking people’s freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong, and not why people came to America or built this country, excuse me. It’s outrage, it’s an outrage. It will cause loss, great, great harm, but not just to Tesla, but any company. And while people will weather the storm there are many small companies that will not,” he said.

He continued sounding more and more incensed, at one point asking, “What the f--k?”

The Bay Area’s orders do not say that people cannot leave their house, but do restrict non-essential businesses from staying open and ban many other activities, such as large public gatherings.

Some states, including Michigan and Texas, have seen protests of stay at home orders as fears about economic deterioration grow. But public health officials have cautioned that reopening too quickly could result in cases of Covid-19 re-accelerating and developing new hot spots that could overwhelm health systems.

And second, a debunked report from BitMEX Research on Wednesday suggested that a critical flaw called ""double spend"" had occurred in the Bitcoin blockchain.

Double spend is when someone is able to spend the same bitcoin twice. It is a feared and dire scenario for the digital asset, and the blockchain was thought to have solved the issue when Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin white paper in 2009.",2021-01-22 11:19:37

Study after study shows that 90% of options traders lose money, that the vast majority of people who try to time the market lose out in the long run, and that almost 92% of actively managed large cap funds lost to the S&P 500 over the last 15 year period. Despite these facts, these losing strategies have been all I have been seeing on this sub over the last few months.

If the data isn't convincing for you, I've got a story for you about the smartest man I know. Only person I know who got a perfect score on the SATs. Undergraduate and graduate degree in economics and finance from an Ivy League school, after which he became a CFA. Earned multi, multi, millions as a portfolio manager, before retiring young in his late 30's or early 40's. You want to know how he invests now that he is retired? Index funds. Do you want to know where he told me most of his hedge fund and mutual fund manager friends invest their own money? Index funds. 

Honestly, over the past few months, wallstreetbets has been a considerably less harmful sub for new investors than here. There seems to be an overarching theme over there that they know they are gamblers and dumbasses, where the options traders here seem to think they are the smartest guys in the room. At least they have funny memes over there to help ease the pain when they inevitably lose their money.

I don't know what the solution to this is, I'm not sure if banning advice that has been statistically proven to lose money for most investors is a good idea. All I know is that this sub has become a place that is peddling advice that will lose new investors money, and I think it's atrocious. End rant.

Edit: the amount of disinformation being up voted in this thread is staggering, people not knowing basic things like what the difference between an ETF and an index fund is and people thinking that portfolio managers only get compensated when they are successful. Case in point.

Edit 2: Since everyone seems to think I am saying everyone should just throw everything in VTI and call it a day because they think that is the only index fund that exits, I'll clarify. If you feel like you have very strong knowledge that a particular sector will outperform, or if you have done a lot of homework and think for example growth stocks are going to crash, it's fine in my opinion to use a low cost index fund to overweight your portfolio towards value. For example, if you think large cap growth is going to continue to outperform, feel free to buy some Fidelity large cap growth index at .035 expense ratio. If you think tech is the way to go, dip your toe into some .08 expense ratio FTEC tech index fund. Hell if you have a stiffy for groceries, go ahead and treat yourself to some .13 % expense ratio XLP consumer staples index (I personally wouldn't buy anything with .1% exp ratio or over, but I don't it's a big mistake for someone to do that.) Using cheap indexes doesn't mean only buy things that completely emulate the market. You can diverge from the market as long as you do it cheaply and within reason.",2020-05-15 02:09:54
294,"When Robinhood users pile into a stock , the average daily return is 14%. But this is followed by a reversal of nearly 5% over the subsequent month",2313,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/jyxfkr/when_robinhood_users_pile_into_a_stock_the/,381," [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-13/herding-by-naive-robinhood-traders-may-be-good-signal-to-short?sref=xTkgnLSf](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-13/herding-by-naive-robinhood-traders-may-be-good-signal-to-short?sref=xTkgnLSf)

&#x200B;

from buying the dip to surfing the tech surge with options, an investor following the Robinhood crowd this year would have a lot to feel good about.

Provided they didn’t follow too long, that is.

Users of the millennial-friendly app -- the first to offer commission-free trading -- are more likely to chase popular stocks with extreme performance. The result is herding that ultimately becomes a drag on those companies’ returns, according to the latest [academic research ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3715077)into retail investing.

 When Robinhood users pile into a stock in large numbers, the average excess return on the day surges to 14%. But this is followed by a reversal of nearly 5% over the subsequent month, a new paper found. 

 

The thinking is that in seeking to make investing easier, the platform’s slimmed-down interface could be resulting in concentrated trading in the most “attention grabbing” shares. That increases the chance of herding which can lead to big market reversals.

“Robinhood users are more subject to attention biases,” wrote authors including behavioral finance pioneer Terrance Odean. “The combination of naïve investors and the simplification of information is associated with herding episodes.”

Robinhood was at the center of Wall Street drama this year as the young fintech firm stirred up an investing [frenzy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-10-22/how-robinhood-s-addictive-app-made-trading-a-covid-pandemic-pastime) amplified by Covid-19 restrictions and stimulus cash.

As retail volumes spiked, even professionals started tracking the activity of Robinhood’s 13 million users in a hunt for fresh trading signals. To do that they relied on data from Robintrack, a website that provided updates on retail stock demand, on which the academics also based their calculations.

One idea from the academic world: A strategy of selling a security after a herding event and buying it five days later delivers a 3.5% return and nearly double that for more extreme scenarios.

In fact, the researchers say there’s good reason to think hedge funds are doing some version of this, since they observed a spike in short interest among shares bought heavily by Robinhood traders.

[Read more: Robinhood Users Weren’t as Reckless as Portrayed During Rally](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-29/robinhood-users-are-a-bit-less-nuts-than-you-were-led-to-believe)

It’s familiar territory for two of the paper’s co-authors. Odean at the University of California, Berkeley, and Brad M. Barber at the University of California, Davis have previously [documented](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/Papers%20current%20versions/AllThatGlitters_RFS_2008.pdf) a tendency for individual investors to buy stock darlings.

In the case of Robinhood, they argue it’s even more extreme, since many users are first-time investors on a platform that offers frictionless trading and only limited information. For instance, users buy equities on the app’s “Top Mover” list more aggressively than other individual investors, meaning they’re more likely to trade extreme losers as well as winners.

“How information is displayed can both help and hurt investors,” wrote the team, which also included Xing Huang at Washington University in St. Louis and Chris Schwarz at the University of California, Irvine. “The simplified user interface influences investors decision.”",2020-11-23 02:29:49

It is important to call out that no single metric is illustrative of the entire market, of course.

300,"Tesla, snubbed by the S&P 500, quickly completes $5 billion stock sale",2280,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ip1731/tesla_snubbed_by_the_sp_500_quickly_completes_5/,636,"The old Wall Street adage is to ""sell high."" Tesla did just that.

A week ago, Tesla announced it would sell $5 billion worth of stock at market prices ""from time to time."" Tuesday it announced it had completed that sale as of Friday.

The exact number of shares sold, and thus the average price of each sale, was not disclosed. Tesla shares have fallen sharply in the recent sell-off of tech stocks. Shares reached a split-adjusted record high close of $498.32 on August 31, but have lost 16% of their value since then through Friday's close. And shares were down another 11% in pre-market trading even before the Tuesday's filing.


The sell-off could be because Tesla was not added to the S&P 500 index, as many investors were expecting would happen, given its market value and recent record of sustained profitability. Being added to the S&amp;amp;P would have forced additional purchases by fund managers whose holders must mirror the blue chip index.

Shares of Tesla are still up about 400% since the start of the year, even with last week's sell-off.

The sale of stock is the second such offering Tesla has done this year to take advantage of the skyrocketing stock price. In February the company raised $2.3 billion through the sale of 3 billion shares. Adjusted for the recent split, that stock sale was at an average price of $151.60 a share.

CEO Elon Musk dismissed the idea of the need for sales of additional shares when asked about it by analysts in January.

“We're actually spending money as quickly as we can spend it sensibly,"" Musk said on a January 29 call, when the company posted its first annual profit. ""There is no artificial hold back on expenditures ... So in light of that, it doesn't make sense to raise money.""

But soon thereafter Tesla decided it didn't make sense to not take advantage of its climbing share price. And if it turns out that its shares hit a peak last week that it might not reach again for a little while, then Tesla apparently sold additional shares at close to that high point.

The faltering labor market recovery and a recent rise in new coronavirus infections has piled pressure on Congress and the White House to come up with another rescue package.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday that Congress and the U.S. central bank needed to “stay with it” in working to support the economy’s recovery. More fiscal stimulus is looking increasingly unlikely before the Nov. 3 presidential election.

“The high level of joblessness shows that the country isn’t out of the woods yet and it won’t be if the pleading of Fed officials for more stimulus isn’t heard by government officials down in Washington,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. “The economy is running on empty.”

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 870,000 for the week ended Sept. 19. Data for the prior week was revised to show 6,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 840,000 applications in the latest week.

305,FT: Nikola founder bought truck designs from third party,2246,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/j0d46n/ft_nikola_founder_bought_truck_designs_from_third/,430,"
* * *
https://www.ft.com/content/9bd5e3f3-4d09-458c-b390-bc94b1f4a024

The original design for Nikola’s flagship truck was purchased by founder Trevor Milton from a designer in Croatia, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, despite company claims in a 2018 lawsuit that the vehicle was initially designed by Mr Milton “in his basement”.

The truck, the Nikola One, is at the centre of a $2bn lawsuit with Tesla, in which Nikola alleges its rival infringed on its patents. Nikola claims in that lawsuit that Mr Milton began designing the model in 2013, with other company staff later working on it.

In a rebuttal to the lawsuit filed last week, Tesla alleged that Nikola could not protect the designs because they did not originate from the company itself, but from Adriano Mudri, a designer based in Croatia.

Two people with knowledge of the transaction told the Financial Times that the Nikola founder bought the designs in 2015 after meeting Mr Mudri while visiting electric supercar maker Rimac in Croatia.

While Tesla’s filing identifies the designer as the source of the original truck drawings, it does not contain details about the transaction, explain that money was exchanged, or that Mr Milton himself orchestrated the purchase.

The latest twist comes with Nikola still reeling from accusations earlier this month that it passed off purchased technology as its own, covering supplier names on key components with stickers when making promotional videos. Nikola said it never claimed it made the components.

In a report that sent Nikola’s shares tanking, Mr Milton was accused of spreading an “ocean of lies” about the company’s technology and its products by short seller Hindenburg Research.

A little over a week later, Mr Milton decided to leave the company, telling staff he planned to defend himself “against false allegations levelled against me by outside detractors”. The 39-year old founder has repeatedly insisted that he has not lied to or deceived anyone about the trucks.

The lawsuit with Tesla, filed during Mr Milton’s tenure, centres on the origins of the designs for the “Nikola One” truck.

The company claims that Mr Milton worked for two years on the truck before, unsatisfied with his designs, he hired designer Steve Jennes in 2015. The lawsuit says the pair then crafted the final design between them in a lengthy process.

When it was finished, Nikola had spent “several million dollars developing the Nikola One”, according to the lawsuit.

In its rebuttal, Tesla said that the designs for the model originated from Mr Mudri, a designer at Rimac, who had dubbed it the “Road Runner”. The design’s origins could raise further questions about Nikola’s intellectual property.

“Trevor Milton chose not to disclose the Road Runner concept truck to the [US Patent and Trademark Office] with deceptive intent,” Tesla said in its filing.

Nikola said: “The Nikola One truck was designed and patented by Nikola. It is commonplace to license third party designs during vehicle development, and although early in the process Nikola purchased a license to Antonio Mudri’s designs, he was not part of the design team and his designs are materially different from the design invented by Nikola for the Nikola One.”

According to several people with knowledge of the deal, Mr Milton sought, unsuccessfully, to collaborate with Rimac on a range of projects in 2015.

On a trip to Rimac’s headquarters on the outskirts of Zagreb, he met Mr Mudri, the company’s designer, who had designed a futuristic truck as part of an earlier diploma project.

Mr Milton purchased the computer drawings and virtual 3D model of the vehicle for several thousand dollars from Mr Mudri, according to two people.

The Road Runner name lingered for months. A person familiar with the development of the Nikola One said that “Road Runner . . . was the internal name for Nikola’s project the entire time we worked on it”.

A screenshot of a Nikola document seen by the Financial Times, shows 13 people being invited to collaborate on the “Nikola Roadrunner Prototype Project”.

Another screenshot shows an early version of Nikola’s website depicting a truck that appears identical to the Road Runner in Tesla’s court filing.

Nikola did not mention Mr Mudri, or Rimac, or say that the designs were purchased, in its 2018 filing against Tesla.

Representatives for Mr Milton declined to comment. Rimac also declined to comment.",2020-09-27 07:22:50

I'll try to quote some relevant sections from the NYT article:

> “I hate to say it, but this is going to take longer and look grimmer than we thought,” Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University, said of the path to recovery.  Mr. Bloom, a co-author of an analysis of the coronavirus epidemic’s effects on the labor market, estimates that 42 percent of recent layoffs will result in permanent job loss.

> “Firms intend to hire these people back,” Mr. Bloom said, referring to a recent survey of businesses done by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. “But we know from the past that these aspirations often don’t turn out to be true.”

>In this case, the economy that comes back is likely to look quite different from the one that closed. If social distancing rules become the new normal, causing thinner crowds in restaurants, theaters and stores, at sports arenas, and on airplanes, then fewer workers will be required.  Large companies already expect more of their workers to continue to work remotely and say they plan to reduce their real estate footprint, which will, in turn, reduce the foot traffic that feeds nearby restaurants, shops, nail salons and other businesses.

Old news. Around $100B(almost 1/5th of its market cap) of TSLA would need to be purchased(some active funds may have already purchased) based on current stock price.

The only reason I have been holding TSLA after it split is the whole S&P 500 inclusion thingy. After that, I don't know what will even move this stock. They freakin surpassed Berkshire and could surpass Facebook(for a short time)!!!

Today they will announce whether to include TSLA in two sessions or in one session.

[This is what happened when Yahoo was included(which is comparable to TSLA's inclusion as they have had relatively comparable size in comparison to S&P 500's size). Although I believe TSLA will rise again after some time, unlike Yahoo.](https://imgur.com/a/1qj22eR)

After the trading sessions, expect a big dip. As a lot of speculators this year have bought into TSLA precisely to front-run the index investors.

Also, the trade date Dec. 18, coincides with a once-quarterly event known as quadruple witching, the Friday near the end of each calendar quarter on which options and futures on both indexes and stocks expire simultaneously. Volume is usually heavy on those days and would help boost liquidity on the day of Tesla’s inclusion, investors said. (this paragraph copied straight from wsj)

So, I guess don't be a fool(unless there are some tax implications, which I don't have); buy the rumour, sell the news. TSLA will completely tank after the inclusion.

Also, remember NIO etc kind of benefit from the TSLA hype, so be very careful you all about them.

I don't think if you don't have any immediate tax implications, there wouldn't be much value holding TSLA for the longer term as there are better long term plays. And when or if TSLA reaches $700 or higher(I know I am very bullish, but that's why I am still holding it) there would be almost no point in holding it any longer.

Some special points to remember:

* TSLA already jumped 40% after its inclusion news broke out and had been steadily climbing before it due to rumour that it will be included in the index and Softbank's trade earlier this year.
* TSLA can issue more shares, especially in this valuation. I mean why wouldn't they, lol.

I know posts that say anything negative about TSLA gets downvoted but be careful about your TSLA shares or options!

Disclaimer: I am long TSLA shares and call options. I am also long PLTR(long leaps too) and some other meme stocks which I am not mentioning cause my post gets removed somehow and I am not sure why(so you know I don't give a damn about valuations, although I am kind of an early mover, so all of them are at a very profitable position).",2020-11-30 23:10:56

340,Bloomberg opinion: unemployment due to coronavirus could surpass Great Depression levels,2086,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fl7863/bloomberg_opinion_unemployment_due_to_coronavirus/,540,"Article here: https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-18/coronavirus-recession-is-already-causing-staggering-job-losses?utm_content=business&cmpid=socialflow-facebook-business&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_source=facebook 

The federal government is moving at a breakneck pace to respond to the coronavirus recession. In the states, however, the preliminary data suggests staggering job losses, exceeding economists’ expectations of just a week ago. If the pattern holds, it will mark the sharpest downturn in the labor market on record.

A spike in initial claims for unemployment insurance is among the earliest signs that a recession is underway. The most recent official number is from the first week of March, and it shows 221,000 claims, roughly on par with the average of the last several months.

State unemployment offices, however, are reporting huge increases in the volume of more recent claims. Hawaii reported 1,500 claims on Monday, five times the previous Monday. From Friday to Tuesday, Connecticut saw 30,000 claims, about 10 times the average for a whole week. Pennsylvania received a staggering 50,000 claims on Monday alone, compared to 12,000 claims for the first week of March.

All of this implies that, for the U.S. as whole, total initial claims for unemployment insurance for this week could spike to over 2 million. During the worst week of the Great Recession, the last week of March 2009, claims reached 665,000.

Some perspective: Even when the economy is booming, hundreds of thousands of workers file for unemployment benefits each week, and an even greater number find new jobs. In December 2007, by way of comparison, the U.S. economy added 108,000 jobs. In March 2009, it lost 800,000.

The correlation between unemployment insurance claims and the monthly payroll report is not exact. But simple extrapolation suggests that next month’s payroll report could show a total decline of roughly 4 million jobs. The human suffering behind that number is overwhelming. It all but requires Congress to pass without delay an increase the amount workers receive in unemployment insurance.

The macroeconomic consequences are if anything more dire. A typical recession gains steam because all workers reduce their spending: Some because they’ve lost their jobs, others because they expect to, others who are worried they might. This effect ripples through the economy.

The first month of major job losses during the Great Recession was February 2008, when the economy shed 906,000 jobs. The effect rippled throughout 2009, and during the entirety of the Great Recession about 8.5 million jobs were lost. A similar multiplier would place total job losses from the current recession at … 37 million.

Again, using back-of-the-envelope math, that implies a rise in the unemployment rate to about 27% — even higher than the 20% Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has warned as possible. It would exceed the highest unemployment on record, 24.9%, set during the Great Depression. To repeat: These are rough estimates based on early data.

Moreover, the coronavirus recession is, structurally speaking, unlike any that have come before it. Many of the measures the public is being asked to take are voluntary, so it is possible that economy could bounce back rapidly once they are lifted. On the other hand, because social distancing will have to continue for months, it could be that the initial shock is compounded several times over.

In either case, the government and the public should be prepared for a dramatic and uncertain economy.",2020-03-19 20:29:16

* Apple and Epic went to court today so that Epic could argue for a temporary court order that would force Apple to unblock Fortnite from its iOS App Store. 

* ""The case is considered a potentially landmark suit, one that tests the frontiers of antitrust law, said Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.""

* Judge Gonzalez Rogers looked skeptically at many of Epic's claims, explicitly telling the company several times in the hearing she was not persuaded by its arguments or its strategy. Epic knew that it was breaching its contract with Apple when it published the update, but did it anyway, she said, accusing the company of dishonesty. She rejected claims that Apple's in-app payment system is a separate product an an example of illegal bundling, as well as that Apple's app store operates as a monopoly.

* Fortnite players on iOS have a variety of choices to access the game even if it is no longer available on iOS, she said. ""Walled gardens have existed for decades,"" she said. ""Nintendo has had a walled garden. Sony has had a walled garden. Microsoft has had a walled garden. What Apple's doing is not much different... It's hard to ignore the economics of the industry, which is what you're asking me to do.""

* Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers recommended a jury trial in the case in July. “It is important enough to understand what real people think,” she said. “Do these security issues concern people or not?” (in reference to Apple's argument that tight control over its App Store to keep customers’ data secure and private.)

* In the coming days, Gonzalez Rogers is expected to rule on a temporary injunction forcing Apple to allow Fortnite back into its App Store and support Unreal Engine, Epic’s software development tools, in the interim.

* Separately on Monday, Google announced it will enforce rules that require app developers distributing Android software on the Google Play Store to use its in-app payment system. The move means that developers who have had customers pay them directly with a credit card for digital content will soon have to use Google’s billing system, which takes a 30% fee from payments.",2020-09-29 11:41:06

(oops - title meant to say ""surge"", sorry)

* * *

U.S pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and German biotech firm BioNTech said their coronavirus vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing Covid-19 among those without evidence of prior infection, according to data published Monday from their late-stage vaccine trial.

It comes as drugmakers and research centers around the world scramble to deliver a safe and effective vaccine in an attempt to bring an end to the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed over 1.25 million lives worldwide.

Scientists are hoping for a coronavirus vaccine that is at least 75% effective, while White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci has previously said one that is 50% or 60% effective would be acceptable.

Albert Bourla, chairman and CEO of Pfizer, hailed the development as a “great day for science and humanity.”

The results were based on the first interim efficacy analysis conducted by an external and independent Data Monitoring Committee from the phase three clinical study. The independent group of experts oversee U.S. clinical trials to ensure the safety of participants.

The analysis evaluated 94 confirmed Covid-19 infections among the trial’s 43,538 participants. Pfizer and BioNTech said the case split between vaccinated individuals and those who received a placebo indicated a vaccine efficacy rate of above 90% at seven days after the second dose.

It means that protection from Covid-19 is achieved 28 days after the initial vaccination, which consists of a two-dose schedule.

The final vaccine efficacy percentage may vary, however, as safety and additional data continues to be collected.

“The first set of results from our Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial provides the initial evidence of our vaccine’s ability to prevent COVID-19,” Pfizer’s Bourla said in a statement.

“We are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most with infection rates setting new records, hospitals nearing over-capacity and economies struggling to reopen,” Bourla continued.

“With today’s news, we are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis. We look forward to sharing additional efficacy and safety data generated from thousands of participants in the coming weeks.”

Roughly 42% of the trial’s participants had diverse backgrounds, Pfizer and BioNTech said, adding that there haven’t been any serious safety concerns reported yet.

The companies said they planned to submit for emergency use authorization to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration soon after they have two months of data, which is currently on track for the third week of November.

Based on current projections, Pfizer and BioNTech expect to produce up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020, and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.

The companies said they plan to submit data from the full phase three trial, which began on July 27, for scientific peer-review publication.

A few weeks ago this nameless Reddit user said he was transitioning 60% of his portfolio into bonds until after the election was decided because he knew the market was going to go down.

He scoffed at my advice that investors who try to time the market often miss gains from some of the biggest trading days and can pay a huge price as a result.

Several [analyses](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/investing/stocks/tempted-to-sell-missing-just-a-handful-of-the-best-stock-market-days-can-tank-your-returns/) show that if you miss out on just the 10 best trading days over a 20-year span, your investment gains will be CUT IN HALF.

Furthermore, I see the same things like 08-09 was the last time we had a serious correction and increasing Covid cases with the weakening dollar could be the catalyst blah blah blah.  Who the hell cares?  This fear mongering of what might happen tomorrow is some shit i'm tryna leave behind in 2020.  The bigger picture here is that our very landscape has changed in the last 2 decades and we have to stop being scared of change and fear of a correction.  Can it happen?  Sure, in fact it probably should happen but will that change anything in the long term?  No.  Here's a few differences between our very economy now versus what it was like 10-20 years ago...

We live in a day and age where more people have access to investing in our history with zero commission trading fees and apps like robinhood, acorns, or betterment that appeal appeal to the beginner investor.  The result is that the younger and younger generations are becoming more involved in the investment sector of the economy.  Coupled with the fact that a large part of these young investors Millenials and Gen Z, do not own a home and/or live with their parents they have more freedom to put their disposable income into the market.  What's interesting is that millennials are actually one of the most cynical generations towards the stock market mostly because we have lived through two major recessions in recent times and have a large distrust placed in large financial institutions.  This seems to have fundamentally changed proportion of americans who are benefitting from the stock markets bull run from an individual standpoint.  However, with the rise of 401(k) benefits offered by employers and expansion of these plans, millennials are shifting more disposable income towards these options as opposed to self directed or individual plans which tells a different story.

We live in a day and age where new financial instruments and investing options are dominating the market popularity.  The historic rise of ETFs approx +6,000 since 2009 have ushered in a new era of low cost diversification for the average investor.  Employers are increasing 401(k) benefits and company match policies allowing for large capital accumulation among younger investors who are reaping the benefits.  The rise of cryptocurrency has brought in an entirely new method to invest in the future which is particularly attractive to the younger generations who have lived through the technology era and have seen what investments in the future can look like.

We live in a day and age where we are exchanging information at the blink of an eye with a simple google search.  Trend identification and data analysis in this day and age is easily accessible and a powerful tool to the average investor.  Things such as cloud computing, AI, Genomics, blockchain, green/renewable energy are changing the foundation of our future and these ideas aren't going away anytime soon.  Access to social media, blogs, investment forums have never been easier and will continue to advance our general education and understanding.

Who knows what the next 10, 20, or even 50 years will bring?  I don't know but i'm certain that **change is here to stay** so stop worrying and embrace the unknown.

While I do agree with you in the fact that some of these company valuations are insane and this bull market cannot be seen as sustainable in the short run I think it's important to weigh those concerns with the macroeconomic factors that have changed the investment landscape in the last 10-20 years.  You should have a healthy dose of skepticism otherwise you will be caught off guard but you should also take into account the investing world is evolving and traditional metrics and guidelines in which investors have traditionally based their investment decisions on needs to adapt with it.  What remains true is that not all great things can last forever and a healthy correction is brewing in the future and trying to time it is, and always will be, the worst mistake you can make.  DCA into your positions has and always will be no matter what the best way to invest.

Who knows what the investment landscape will look like in 10-50 years?  Creative destruction in our world knows no bounds and we are constantly advancing toward it.  Change is brought on by optimism and in a 2020 lacking that - heres to a forward looking future built on the backs of bulls!

&#x200B;

Edit 1:  Been getting a lot of traction and appreciation as well as hate for this post so I want to clarify a few things about what i'm tryna say here.

1.  I am not saying invest heavy into Technology/Clean energy or any of the other crazy shit that's been popping cause it will stay that way.  I am saying that look at what technology and advancements we have made just in the last 10-20 years as a global population and tried to tie it to financial advancements related to technology.  What will the next 50 years bring?  I don't know but i'm excited to find out.
2. I am aware that we are in uncharted waters here as a country and there are a lot of risks regarding the economy right now.  You'd be an idiot to think that there are not going to be consequences for the amount of money printing we've been doing.  The M1 money supply just shot up this last year and if we hit inflation we could be in trouble.  Invest smart, look for value, average in, don't buy into the hype/FOMO, you'll be setting yourself up for some losses.
3. My post is geared to a lot of the newer investors that are coming into this space trying to figure out what the fuck to do with their money.  A lot of them are scared about what could happen with the economic factors right now.  I am saying that look at us as a whole in a broader sense of the market - look what we have done in the past 10-20 years as a nation and as a global population.  It's fucking exciting and that innovation and drive for the next generation future will never stop.  Think long term always as a new investors, you're young and can handle losses.  I saw a comment on another thread saying ""take your initial losses as tuition in learning how to invest"" and that is the mindset of a winner in the long run.  Investment in yourself and making your dollar work for you is building that future and its exciting.
4. Stop calling me stupid/naive it hurts my feelings lol.  I'm a youngin who wants all this 2020 fear and negativity to stop and I want my fellow youngins to join me in building a better future.

Cheers!

Edit 2: Thanks for Gold!

One of the biggest obstacles to active stock picking (as opposed to indexing) seems to be with all the problems with timing the market. We tend to want to buy when others want to buy, and less when others are fearful (i.e. the worst timing). 

But this strategy seems attractive. You pick high quality companies that you think will surge over the next 20 years (Amazon, Tesla, Disney, whatever you think) and NEVER SELL. 

This takes out some of the issues with active investing where people are getting in and out of the market at all the wrong times. 

What do you think? Would this solve any of the problems with active investing?

edit: lots of awesome comments but I think some people aren't being as charitable to the proposal as they should. Using examples of companies that rose and fall after 30 years isn't very fair to the main idea behind this proposal. Let's say buy and hold for 10 years minimum.

And instead, passengers are called ""end-users"". These definitions allow them to adjust their sales:

> LONDON (Reuters) - S&P Dow Jones Indices, a division of financial data provider S&P Global Inc, said on Thursday that it will launch cryptocurrency indices in 2021, making it the latest major finance company to enter the nascent asset class.

> The S&P DJI-branded products will use data from New York-based virtual currency company Lukka on more than 550 of the top traded coins, the companies said.  S&P’s clients will be able to work with the index provider to create customized indices and other benchmarking tools on cryptocurrencies, S&P and Lukka said in a joint statement.  S&P and Lukka hope more reliable pricing data will make it easier for investors to access the new asset class, and reduce some of the risks of the very volatile and speculative market, they said.

> “With digital assets such as cryptocurrencies becoming a rapidly emerging asset class, the time is right for independent, reliable and user-friendly benchmarks,” said Peter Roffman, global head of innovation and strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The move by one of the world’s most well-known index providers could help cryptocurrencies become more mainstream investments. It comes as bitcoin continues to soar to record highs against the dollar, boosted by increased demand from investors who say the virtual currency is a hedge against inflation and a safe-haven asset.

> Bitcoin was trading at $19,300 in latest trading on Thursday, having soared around 170% this year. Cryptocurrencies have been around for more than a decade, but have started attracting more interest from large financial companies over the last few years.

> Large firms including Fidelity Investments and Japan’s Nomura Holdings Inc have starting safeguarding bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies for institutional investors, while major exchanges have started offering bitcoin derivatives. The emergence of more mainstream market infrastructure has made the asset class more accessible for institutional investors, with hedge fund managers such as Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller saying they include bitcoin in their broad investment strategies.

So, what are the implications for bitcoin and the nascent cryptocurrency industry?",2020-12-04 01:28:39

In our report, we explained how the company released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAToxJ9CGb8&feature=youtu.be) called “Nikola One in Motion”, which made it seem that its Nikola One semi-truck was traveling under its own power at a high rate of speed. Angles in the video were edited to make it appear as though the semi was moving on a roadway that was flat, or even uphill.

In Monday’s response, the company acknowledged that its vehicle was not functioning under its own power, and instead, was apparently simply showcasing the power of gravity. It claimed that using the term “in motion” dispelled the deceptive nature of the video.

We disagree. Beyond common sense, the company referred to the Nikola One as “**the 1,000 HP**, zero-emission Nikola One semi-truck” in the description of its video. Obviously, the truck can’t have 1,000 horsepower or even 1 horsepower if it doesn’t power itself.

398,"Spreadsheet to calculate GME Exit Strategy, ROI Calculations & Breakeven Analysis",1920,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l47jf5/spreadsheet_to_calculate_gme_exit_strategy_roi/,296,"**PLEASE DROP AN UPVOTE AND/OR COMMENT IF YOU USE. IT TOOK ME A FEW HOURS TO MAKE THIS SPREADSHEET AND I WOULD LIKE TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE OPENING AND DUPLICATING THE SHEET, PLEASE HELP PAY IT FORWARD.**

Disclaimer: I originally created this tool for WSB, but it looks like I am muted there for some reason, so I figured I would share on some other subs where people are also talking about GME.

This whole experience has been (and will be) a crazy trip, but you don't want to be the one caught holding the bag when it eventually comes crashing down to earth. **HAVE AN EXIT STRATEGY.** Everyone has different levels of expendable capital and risk tolerance. Some of us can afford to YOLO away six-figure investments, while others would be more than happy to simply turn a few hundred dollars into a grand.

Your exit strategy should depend on how much money you are comfortable losing, and how much profits you would be happy taking. I'm not here to tell you what your strategy should be, but I did make a tool so you can figure it out for yourself: [Exit Strategy Calculator (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13twJC8Ldy3p7iS7fp5htOjfhTYZIE_Fqa5Rn9wgqv8c/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

**HOW TO USE THE EXIT STRATEGY PLANNER**

\- Note 1: **This is for shares only**. I'm not smart enough to make this work for options.

\- Note 2: The link I provided is READ ONLY, so the first step is to **make a copy** for your own use (File --> make a copy)

\- **Now, enter your current position.** Provide the number of shares you have in A3, and your average cost basis in B3 (these cells are highlighted in yellow). Your total investment will automatically calculate in C3.

\- **Columns E-F are the ROI calculator.** Column F tells you what the share price will need to reach in order to hit the ROI listed in Column E. Column G tells you what your total value would be at that share price.

\- **Columns I-K are your break-even analysis**, which basically tells you what the share price would need to be for you to break even by selling X number of your shares, and what your profit would be if you sold all of them at said price. *You will probably want to adjust the #s in Column I based on how many shares you currently have in your position*. Columns J & K will automatically update when you do.

\- **Columns M-N calculate your profits at different share prices.** How much money will you make if you sell when GME hits $80? What about $100, or $250, or even $1,000? These columns will tell you. Feel free to adjust the share prices in column M if you want, but I have most of the big milestones covered.

\- **Columns P-R are your exit strategy planner.** *You will need to provide the following information: # of shares (if any) you want to hold long term, post-squeeze \[cell P4\]. Maximum dollar amount from your initial investment that you can stomach losing \[Q4\]. Profit amount you would be 100% happy cashing out with no FOMO of future gains \[R3\].* Cell Q6 will calculate your ""worst case scenario"" sell price. **Set a stop loss order at this price to maximize your losses** to the amount you entered in Q4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares. Cell Q7 will calculate your ""best case scenario"" sell price. **Set a limit order at this price to cash out with your ""100% satisfied profit""** you entered in R4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares.

\- **Columns T-V is an incremental sales planner.** Some of you may want to sell a portion of your shares when certain benchmarks are hit (ie sell 10 shares when it hits $100, another 10 at $150, etc.). Simply enter in how many shares you want to sell at each price point \[column U\], and the sheet will calculate your cumulative revenues, net profit, and remaining shares.

TLDR: Use this spreadsheet to avoid getting caught holding the bag on GME when all of the shorts are officially squeezed. Make a copy for yourself and change the cells highlighted in yellow to account for your personal position and risk/reward preferences.

Of course you can use this spreadsheet for your other investments, but let's be honest... half of us seem to be all in on GME right now. Big week ahead, may all of our profits be plentiful!

**EDIT:** A few people have mentioned that the file traffic was too high and it was not allowing them to make a copy. Fear not! I have made some alternate sheets you can use instead (they are all the same).

One Chicago-resident flipped his sister’s stimulus check into nearly $10,000.",1858,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/gzpcp0/cnbc_robinhood_traders_cash_in_on_the_market/,413,"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/09/robinhood-traders-cash-in-on-the-market-comeback-that-billionaire-investors-missed.html

One 26-year-old Robinhood trader made $1,500 in less than 24 hours betting on a beaten-down airline stock, while many so-called experts on Wall Street warned about buying into an overvalued stock market that was bound to tumble again amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

Last Thursday, Lequon Godbolt, purchased a call option for American Airlines that made him $200 on the millennial-favored stock trading app.

After seeing reports that the airline was increasing domestic flying for summer travel, Godbolt bought another call option minutes before the close. When the market opened higher last Friday after a surprisingly positive jobs report, Godbolt raked in his profits. 

“I just started taking it seriously about two months ago,” Godbolt — a New York resident— told CNBC. “I’ve been watching AAL since the beginning of that time and I felt eventually, once Covid relaxed, markets would move up.”

Godbolt is not alone is his success trading this market. One Chicago-resident flipped his sister’s stimulus check into nearly $10,000. 

Robinhood traders lived up to their outlaw name during the coronavirus market downturn. The young investors booked profits — trading stocks with some of the best returns in the past two months — while other Wall Street veterans were left scratching their heads. 

“There’s nothing like momentum begetting momentum,” Tim Welsh, founder and CEO of wealth management consulting firm Nexus Strategy, told CNBC. “The aspect of just access is really driving a lot of this and the whole upward tick in the markets, again, just fuels demand.”

Young investors, like Godbolt, appeared to have a prescient understanding of the market, unlike the billionaire hedge fund managers who said stocks would retest their lows. Longtime investor Stanley Druckenmiller — who misjudged equities’ comeback — said Monday that the market’s strong performance over the last three weeks has “humbled” him and that he underestimated the power of the Federal Reserve.

Even legendary investor Warren Buffett sold his stake in airlines during the pandemic. Of course, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman is a long-term, bargain shopper and the airline industry’s long-term outlook is yet to be determined. 

V-shape after all?
Signs are pointing to a V-shaped recovery — a sharp fall in economic activity followed by a dramatic rise — in the economy. This theory was rejected by economists and investors who found it unrealistic due to the detrimental ramifications of the mandated shutdown of the U.S. economy. 

Stocks have soared in June, helped by the historic Labor Department jobs report that showed the U.S. economy added a record 2.5 million jobs in May. Wall Street was calling for a decline of 8.3 million. The unemployment rate dropped to 13.3%, far better than the expected 19.5% rate.",2020-06-10 02:30:27

Nonfarm payrolls jumped by 4.8 million in June and the unemployment rate fell to 11.1% as the U.S. continued its reopening from the coronavirus pandemic, the Labor Department said Thursday.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting a 2.9 million increase and a jobless rate of 12.4%. The report was released a day earlier than usual due to the July Fourth U.S. holiday.

The numbers capture the move by all 50 states to get activity moving again after the virus seized up much of the U.S., particularly service-related industries.

However, because the government survey comes from the middle of the month, it does not account for the suspension or rollbacks in regions hit by a resurgence in coronavirus cases.

The unemployment rate also likely is understated due to counting errors at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Workers who still have jobs but have not been working are being counted as employed and even though as supposed to be considered unemployed under BLS rules.",2020-07-02 23:32:16

It's not just a term for stocks going down or a particularly deep dip to buy. 

Bear markets act a certain way, last a certain amount of time and certainly don't magically reset back into the last bull market we had. There will be a new bull market (at some point) but it likely will be very different from the nature of the one that is now dead and buried that we all loved so much from 2009 - 2020. Expect different market leadership, different return patterns and certainly a different duration. 

The good news is that typically the sharper the drop into bear market territory, the quicker the recovery is.

Ark Invest's Cathie Wood isn't betting on Uber Technologies Inc UBER, -1.55% and LYFT Inc LYFT, -2.42% over Tesla Inc TSLA, +2.44%.

What Happened: Wood, CEO of New York-based Ark Invest, said in a tweet Saturday night that Uber and Lyft missed out on a data opportunity that ties in to AI — and which companies will most benefit from it.

Wood said the ride-sharing companies ""stayed private too long and lost the plot. They could have incentivized their drivers to put sensors on their cars and collect data much faster than even $TSLA.""

The tweet was in response to a question about Ark Invest's portfolio.

Data collection and AI are closely intertwined because machine learning systems develop faster and with greater precision when they are paired with large data sets.

> A California judge granted a preliminary injunction Monday requiring Uber and Lyft to stop classifying their drivers as independent contractors pending further action by the court. The order will take effect after 10 days, as the companies requested a brief stay during the appeals process.
> 
> If upheld, the ruling could have serious implications for Uber and Lyft, both of which are not yet profitable and have seen their ride-hailing businesses suffer during the pandemic. By classifying their drivers as independent workers, rather than employees, the companies have not had to pay for costly benefits that come with a full-time staff. 
> 
> California Attorney General Xavier Becerra requested the injunction as part of a lawsuit he brought in May along with city attorneys from San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego. The suit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, alleged Uber and Lyft violated the state’s new law known as Assembly Bill 5 (AB5), which was created as a way to classify gig workers as full employees and ensure benefits from their employers. Uber and Lyft were among a group of tech companies that have previously opposed the bill, arguing their workers enjoy the flexibility of creating their own schedules as contractors. 
> 
> California officials sought an injunction on the alleged misclassification and restitution for workers and civil penalties worth up to hundreds of millions of dollars.
> 
> Shares of Uber were down 0.8% during extended trading Monday and Lyft shares were down 1.7%.
> 
> Both companies said they would appeal the ruling immediately.
> 
> “The vast majority of drivers want to work independently, and we’ve already made significant changes to our app to ensure that remains the case under California law,” an Uber spokesperson said. “When over 3 million Californians are without a job, our elected leaders should be focused on creating work, not trying to shut down an entire industry during an economic depression.”
> 
> “Drivers do not want to be employees, full stop,” Lyft said in a statement. “We’ll immediately appeal this ruling and continue to fight for their independence. Ultimately, we believe this issue will be decided by California voters and that they will side with drivers.” 
> 
> “The court has weighed in and agreed: Uber and Lyft need to put a stop to unlawful misclassification of their drivers while our litigation continues,” Becerra said in a statement. “While this fight still has a long way to go, we’re pushing ahead to make sure the people of California get the workplace protections they deserve. Our state and workers shouldn’t have to foot the bill when big businesses try to skip out on their responsibilities. We’re going to keep working to make sure Uber and Lyft play by the rules.”
> 
> Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi advocated for a “third way” to classify workers in a letter to President Donald Trump in March as the first round of coronavirus relief measures were being negotiated. He argued there should be a way for workers to gain protections without sacrificing the flexibility of contract work.
> 
> In the ruling, Judge Ethan Schulman recognized the value of flexibility offered by Uber and Lyft, writing, “The Court does not take lightly Defendants’ showing that a preliminary injunction may also have an adverse effect on some of their drivers, many of whom desire the flexibility to continue working as they have in the past, and may have commitments that make it difficult if not impossible for them to become full-time employees.”
> 
> But Schulman wrote that Uber and Lyft’s concerns that the injunction would have “far-reaching effects” had “only been exacerbated by Defendants’ prolonged and brazen refusal to comply with California law. Defendants may not evade legislative mandates merely because their businesses are so large that they affect the lives of many thousands of people.”
> 
> Schulman wrote that any impact of the injunction on Uber and Lyft’s businesses would likely be mitigated by the fact that both have said the “vast majority of their drivers work on a casual or sporadic basis” and the reality that the coronavirus pandemic has “drastically reduced the demand for Defendants’ services.”
> 
> “Now, when Defendants’ ridership is at an all-time low, may be the best time (or the least worst time) for Defendants to change their business practices to conform to California law without causing widespread adverse effects on their drivers,” Schulman wrote.
> 
> Uber and Lyft sought to delay the ruling until there was a ruling on Uber’s constitutional challenge of AB5 or until voters weighed in on a ballot measure they sponsored to exempt them from the law. The Court dismissed those requests.
> 
> Schulman said Uber’s arguments that drivers’ work was outside the ordinary course of its business, as the standard requires, was “a classic example of circular reasoning.” He summarized the argument as saying that since Uber views itself as a tech company, only its tech workers are its employees.
> 
> “Were this reasoning to be accepted, the rapidly expanding majority of industries that rely heavily on technology could with impunity deprive legions of workers of the basic protections afforded to employees by state labor and employment laws,” the judge wrote.
> 
> The ruling does not end the legal battles for Uber and Lyft, however. Last week, California’s Labor Commissioner announced lawsuits against the companies alleging wage theft due to misclassification. The commission seeks to recover wages it believes were owed to drivers currently classified as contractors. The suits were filed in Alameda County Superior Court.",2020-08-11 08:27:44
443,TSLA - Tesla market value today is more valuable than all the world's major auto makers combined - what gives?,1778,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ks3xo6/tsla_tesla_market_value_today_is_more_valuable/,909,"Tesla market value today (716 Billion) is about the same as  the market value of all the world's major car makers combined.  In addition China's BYDDY (86B) and Nio (78B) are both more valuable than Daimler (74B) even though NIO only delivered less than 40,000 cars in all of 2020 with huge loss. China's LI and XPEV combined market value are similar to GM (61B), which has production in China and has a worldwide lineup of EV to be on the market in the next few years.

With the exception of autonomous driving, EV manufacturing appears to have a low technology barrier to entry, that's why we have so many EV car companies pops up all over the world. Everybody used the same Total Addressable Market to justify their future value. I don't think autonomous driving is a must have in buying an EV, so the competition will be intense once all ICV companies start to produce their lineup of EVs in the near future.

Since Auto industry is a cyclical business, historically, the market value of the auto companies were somewhat depressed as compared to other high growth industries. Since there is a limit on how many cars will be sold in a year based on historical trends, I don't know how we can justify doubling or tripling the total market value of the whole auto industry unless all the non-Tesla companies lost significant amount of their market value, which is not likely (you are talking about fierce competitors like Toyota, Daimler, Honda, GM, etc)

The first movers (Tesla, BYDDY, Nio, Xpev) are catching all the investment dollars, driving their stock to current nose bleeding price.  Once all major car makers start to deliver EVs, supply and demand will determine their profit margin, future cash flow and true present value.

""**The COVID-19 pandemic has likely accelerated a long-expected rationalization of retail capacity in the US. Our modeling suggests that 15-17% of US malls may no longer be viable as shopping centers and need to be redeveloped into other uses.** While that is a big number, it is lower than the share of loans that are currently in default in the sector (about one third are delinquent, based on CMBS data). With e-commerce having taken a large chunk of market share, and social distancing reducing foot traffic, 2020 has seen a record number of store closures. Street-front retail will also suffer high vacancies and corresponding rent cuts, but should be a better-performing asset because it does not have the same tipping-point risk that malls bear once a certain volume of stores are vacant.""

""**For failing malls, many of the most likely redevelopment options – conversion to residential or warehouses – could result in valuations falling 60-90% compared to preCOVID appraisals.** While the land that has housed malls may offer better recovery values if used for mixed-use developments, historically that has only happened for about 15% of former malls (and those at a time when a very small number of malls required redevelopment at any moment).""

""**In Europe, the situation is less dire due to a relatively small per-capita retail footprint**. So, while we expect some re-rating of rents, a large jump in malls that require redevelopment seems unlikely.""

""**The bright spot is warehouses, where Amazon might need to triple its end-2019 footprint just to efficiently operate its current business.** And of course, Amazon is only one of a multitude of e-commerce players. However, such growth is unlikely to provide a backstop for malls, due to issues around zoning and building suitability, a limited need for new warehouses compared to the amount of mall space that may need to be retired, and the lower average rents for warehouses compared to performing retail.""

**EDIT1:**  /u/exaggerate_a_point summed up my ask better than my own attempt so I'll add it here instead of responding to similar comments:

> OP specifically said he/she wants to de-risk, aka diversify. It's not about not holding good companies, it's about hedging the risk if one has a bad series of news or events. It's inherently risky if your portfolio is heavily weighted in a handful of companies.

Another good summary of the ask for this discussion from /u/FerociousGiraffe :

>Trying to move your portfolio away from FAANG isn’t to say those are great, successful, hugely profitable companies. You’d keep a position in them. It’s about protecting against news that will only hurt FAANG while not hurting the broader market.

**EDIT3:**  Outside of suggestions like ""Why do you hate winning?"", some of the top solutions to dilute these stocks from your S&P 500 / U.S. equities part of a portfolio:

* Many suggest a variation of my original post of simply adding more sector funds outside of tech.  Though this strategy will unfortunately remove many non-giant tech companies in this sector.

* Many of you like /u/desquibnt suggests equal weighted ETFs like RSP.  However, RSP has a high net expense ratio of 0.20%.  

* /u/TriathlonNerd suggests a reverse cap weighted ETF like RVRS.  This too has a high net expense ratio of 0.29%.

* /u/BubbyginkESO and others suggests going broader than just 500 companies with low cost total market funds like Vanguard's VTI or Fidelity's FZROX.  While these 5 stocks still make up the top holdings, the effect of a larger basket of stocks also dilutes these companies.  So far, I like this simple and practical one the best.",2020-08-29 02:17:31

However, when the country eventually pulls out of its current health and economic crises, Americans will be left with a debt hangover.

&#x200B;

On Thursday, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that for fiscal year 2020, which ended September 30, the US deficit hit $3.13 trillion -- or 15.2% of GDP -- thanks to the chasm between what the country spent ($6.55 trillion) and what it took in ($3.42 trillion) for the year.

&#x200B;

As a share of the economy, the estimated 2020 deficit is more than triple what the annual deficit was in 2019. And it's the highest it has been since just after World War II.

The reason for the huge year-over-year jump is simple: Starting this spring, the federal government spent [more than $4 trillion](https://www.covidmoneytracker.org/) to help stem the economic pain to workers and businesses caused by sudden and widespread business shutdowns. And most people agree more money will need to be spent until the White House manages to get the Covid-19 crisis under control.

&#x200B;

The Treasury Department won't put out final numbers for fiscal year 2020 until later this month. But if the CBO's estimates are on the mark, the country's total debt owed to investors -- which is essentially the sum of annual deficits that have accrued over the years -- will have outpaced the size of the economy, coming in at nearly 102% of GDP, according to calculations from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

&#x200B;

The debt hasn't been that high since 1946, when the federal debt was 106.1% of GDP.""Debt is the size of the economy today, and soon it will be larger than any time in history,"" CRFB president Maya MacGuineas said.

&#x200B;

The problem with such high debt levels going forward is that they will increasingly constrain what the government can do to meet the country's needs.

&#x200B;

Spending is projected to continue rising and is far outpacing revenue. And interest payments alone on the debt -- even if rates remain low -- will consume an ever-growing share of tax dollars.

&#x200B;

Given the risks of future disruptions, like a pandemic, a debt load that already is outpacing economic growth puts the country at greater risk of a fiscal crisis, which in turn would require sharp cuts to the services and benefits on which Americans rely.

&#x200B;

""There is no set tipping point at which a fiscal crisis becomes likely or imminent, nor is there an identifiable point at which interest costs as a percentage of GDP become unsustainable,"" CBO director Phillip Swagel said last month. ""But as the debt grows, the risks become greater.""

The average age of those with at least a mere $1 million is 62, a number that hasn’t budged in years.


About 172,000 U.S. households have net worths of at least $25 million, Spectrem estimated last year. That’s up from 84,000 in 2008.


About nine in ten investors under 38 attributed their success to “inheritance” and “family connections” in the Spectrem survey. But the same proportion also said “hard work” and “running my own business” played a role. 
About 70 percent of the richest investors said they’re still working.

Yellen, 74, will have her work cut out for her, with the U.S. economy in the midst of the deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression. But Yellen’s deep experience with macroeconomics, in addition to her familiarity with the inner workings of Washington, could prove to be useful tools as the Biden administration takes a swing at a fiscal response to the crisis.

Yellen will be the first woman to hold the position, and only the second Fed chair to serve in the role (G. William Miller).",2020-11-24 07:15:22

* They invested $1000 into each of the 25 companies in their portfolio.
* They refused to sell any of their holdings. Even when the tech bubble burst and during the housing crisis.
* We will stick to American blue chips that have been around for at least 15-20 years and pay a dividend. This excludes tech stocks from our portfolio. (You can try replacing one of the companies with IBM if you’d like.)
* Emphasis will be on companies that the investor has experience dealing with in their day to day lives. So the portfolio will be skewed towards consumer staples and retail a bit.
* All dividends have been reinvested as soon as they were paid out.
* Any special dividends and spinoffs were sold and the cash proceeds were reinvested into the parent company.
* We’ll include 3 famous former blue chips that have gone bankrupt. Any spinoffs and dividends were reinvested into the company that went bankrupt. Feel free to include a company of your choice (Sears, Toys R Us, Eastman Kodak etc).

Some thoughts for those who would like to build a similar portfolio

Look for companies that

* Have a business model that you understand properly.
* Consistently generate excess returns on invested capital compared to the market as a whole.
* Companies that maintain a clean balance sheet. Metrics to look at would be NetDebt/EBITDA, Debt/Equity and Interest Coverage ratio.
* Many boring consumer staples have historically outperformed the market because they grow earnings reliably and tend not to be overpriced in general.

Buy said companies when

* They are trading at a discount compared to historic levels. Metrics to look at would be EV/EBITDA, dividend yield, FCF yield.
* However, avoid buying companies that have heavily compromised their balance sheet. If the free cash flow barely covers the dividend, stay away. If the interest coverage ratio is in the low single digits, stay away.
* Avoid buying overpriced stocks. Even the best companies will offer subpar returns when you overpay. KO has slightly underperformed the market because it was trading at a PE in the 50s during its peak in the late 90s.

You can get all this information from Morningstar or Value Line that most public libraries provide free access to. Or you can calculate it from the sec filings [https://www.sec.gov/](https://www.sec.gov/).

Keeping this in mind will keep you from panic selling when the market sees a downturn. In fact, it’ll even help you buy excellent companies at a nice discount. **This isn't a guarantee to outperform the market, but it's a fairly straightforward approach that increases your odds of doing so**.

&#x200B;

EDIT: To people who feel like it's easy to pick a winning portfolio in hindsight are missing the point. I'm trying to show you can build a winning portfolio from large cap blue chips without taking on unnecessary risks. The worst a company can do is go to zero. At best, the sky is the limit. You can try replacing the big winners (MO, BF.A, CHD) with a few more bankruptcies or try other names such as TGT, CPB, CLX etc and see how the portfolio performs. You probably won't be able to repeat Lynch or Buffet's performances, but a couple of hundred basis points is realistic in the long run.

For people asking why I chose the stocks I did, a professor from Wharton picked the top companies from the late 50s to see what types of companies provided the best returns. Over the past 50 years, consumer staples were some of the best performers because

1. They are generally not very capital intensive.
2. Their earnings are the least cyclical
3. Consumer staples generally trade at a lower valuations because they have lower earnings growth. This often translates to lower price to earnings growth ratios. MO and PM are two such stocks that fit that criteria today. GIS below $45 a share would also fall into that category.

This is the second post in the series. You do not need to read the first part for this part to make sense, but if you are not familiar with the concept of equity, you may find it helpful.

The first post, which goes over the concept of equity, can be found here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fdx8tw/options\_basics\_what\_is\_equity\_and\_why\_should\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fdx8tw/options_basics_what_is_equity_and_why_should_i/)

This post will explain what put and call options are. From there, it will delve into our first valuation and trading concept, which has to do with volatility as the title suggests. There is an opportunity to apply your knowledge at the end.

This is a bit of a long post because it introduces a lot of new concepts. I will try to make subsequent posts shorter. I suggest taking a break and coming back to this post later if you start to get tired or confused. You can take this in bites, so no need to swallow it like a snake.

**Puts and Calls**

**A put is the right, but not the obligation, to sell an asset for a specific price.** The asset the put holder has a right to sell is called the **“underlying.”** The price at which the put option allows the option holder to sell is called the **“strike.”** Put options have an **expiration date**, after which they cannot be exercised, which is to say you owner of the put option can no longer invoke their right to sell after the option has expired. Now, let’s put it all together into once sentence: **When a person trades a put option, they are trading the right to sell the underlying at the strike price, subject to the eventual expiration.** 

That sounds great, but how could the right to sell something at a certain price be valuable? At this point, you need to have a notion of what “market price” means. Let’s review for a moment before we dive in, using stocks as an example. When you trade a stock, you buy or sell that stock based on an agreed upon price. Traders can bid (offer to purchase) or “ask” (offer to sell) a stock at any price, but only when one trader’s bid to buy is higher than another trader’s ask to sell does a trade actually occur. That point of overlap is called the “market price.” In reality, the bid involved will end up being slightly higher than the ask, and a series of financial institutions ultimately make their money by pocketing the difference, but for our purposes, we’ll say that the market price is just where bids and asks collide. For our purposes, we may also refer to the market price as the “spot price” for now. Either term is fine for the moment.

**Puts have value because the strike price of a put may be different than the market price of the underlying.** For example, if you own a put with a strike of $5, and the underlying has a market price of $3, you have the right to buy the underlying for $3, and then turn around and exercise that put to sell the underlying to collect $5, ultimately making $2 of profit. That $2 is called the “intrinsic value” of the put option. **The intrinsic value of an option is how much you could theoretically profit at a given moment if you exercise it.**

Here is another way to look at intrinsic value: at the very moment when the option is just about to expire, and there is not enough time for the underlying price to change before expiration, the option would be worth $2. In other words, the option holder could theoretically sell their option and collect $2 instead of exercising it. Why an option holder might choose to sell rather than exercise an option will become clear as you read this series. What it comes down to is that the amount you can sell an option for may be greater than the amount you could stand to profit by exercising it. In other words, **an option may be worth more than its intrinsic value except at the exact moment of expiration**; just how is discussed later in this post.

For now though, it’s alright to be content with the notion that put options have value and that an option holder may choose to sell a put option rather than exercise it. Remember, the definition; a put is “the right, but *not* the obligation” to sell.

Now, let’s define call options, using what we have learned about puts: **A call option is the right, but not the obligation to buy (not sell) an underlying asset at a strike price, subject to expiration.** It should come as little surprise that call options also have value for reasons similar to put options. See for yourself. **Question 1:** if you had a call option with a strike of $5, and the underlying had a market price of $10, how much could you profit by exercising your call option to buy the underlying and then turning around and selling the underlying on the market? I’ll put the answer at the end of this post.

**Remember, calls let you buy at the strike. Puts let you sell at the strike.**

Like put options, call options can be traded, their intrinsic value is based on the difference between the strike price and the market price of the underlying, and they may be worth more than their intrinsic value except at the moment they expire. 

Let’s recap: puts are a right to sell, and calls are a right to buy. One good way to remember it is to imagine the underlying were a dog; if you call the dog, it will come to you. Puts and calls can both be exercised or traded. The option holder gets to decide if they want to exercise or trade, but the option can’t be exercised after it expires. Depending on the price of the underlying, exercising can lead to profits, and that possibility is why options have value.

We will now go over what can cause an option to trade for more than its intrinsic value. There are a few variables that can affect options valuation. We have mentioned two so far; 1) the strike price of the option and 2) the market price of the underlying. Volatility is the first one we will go over (later in this post) because it is the easiest to understand given only the strike and the spot. In future posts, we will go over the role of the time left until expiration and the role of prevailing interest rates; specifically something called the “riskless rate,” or “rf” for short. There are other variables that can be incorporated into options pricing models, but we will not address them until we have gone over at least two models that deal with these first five. 

To be clear, we are building up to being able to use 2 models that both incorporate five key variables, and you’ll be able to use 3 of the variables a simplified version of one of the two models by the end of this post. The key variables are, as previously stated:

1. The strike of the option, which we will call “K”

2. The market price of the underlying, which we will call “S.” S stands for “spot,” which for now we will just say is another name for the market price.

3. The volatility of the spot price

4. The time left until the option expires

5. The “riskless rate” briefly mentioned above

K and S determine intrinsic value. The other variables deal more with what we call “time value.”

**Intrinsic Value versus Time Value**

Let’s consider a call option with a strike of $8 (K=$8). Let’s say the market price or spot price is $9 (S = $9). If you were to exercise at that moment, you would make exactly $1 in profit (intrinsic value = $1 because $9 - $8 = $1). This uses the same logic we went over above. If you don’t get it, try doing Question 1, asking for help in the comments, or DMing me. 

But what if we knew that the price of the underlying (S) could change? For simplicity’s sake, we’ll assume for now that S can change exactly once before expiration. We’ll also assume that, when S does change, it will change to either $6 (go down by $3) or $12 (go up by $3), and there is a 50% chance of each of those possible changes happening. Finally, we’ll assume that the change is about to occur this instant, so no time will pass before the single change, and the change will happen instantly. This is a lot to assume, but the assumptions will become less ridiculous as we are variables to our model.

If S goes to $12, intrinsic value would become $4 because $12 - $8 = $4. If S goes down to $6, the call is worth $0. Why is it not worth $-2? Remember, a call option is the right, but **not the obligation** to buy the underlying at the strike, so the option holder does not need to buy the underlying for $8 when the spot price is at $6; they can just decide not to exercise the option and let it expire worthless. 

Let’s recap: There is a 50% change the option will be worth $4 at expiration and a 50% chance it will be worth $0 at expiration. The option has $1 of intrinsic value right now. It also has what practitioners call “time value,” which is the value of the chance of the option having intrinsic value later. This time value is not to be confused with “the time value of money” which is a different concept. 

Let’s see how much time value this option has, starting with the single most important fact about option valuation: **The total value of an option is a function of its probability weighted future payoffs.** In this case, to find that total value, you multiply the value of each outcome by the likelihood it will happen. 50%\*$4 + 50%\*$0 = $2, so the total value of the option is $2. Subtract the intrinsic value of $1 from the total value, and you get $1 of time value. 

Before we do another example, this time with a put option, let’s quickly examine why it is worth breaking out the value of an option into intrinsic value versus time value. As I implied, **total option value = time value + intrinsic value**, and intrinsic value is S-K (spot – strike) for a call option and K-S (strike – spot) for a put option. You may recall I said that the one time an option’s total value is equal to its intrinsic value is at the moment of expiration because the underlying spot price has no time left to change. The implication here is that if total value approximates intrinsic value as the option nears expiration, then time value ultimately decreases to $0. Describing mathematically how the time value changes over time and eventually gets to $0 will require all five variables in either of our models – so that’s something to look forward to. For now, just be aware that this feature of options valuation exists. 

Let’s take the simplified model we have already used to value a call and apply it to value a put option. I’m going to start using the variables without restating what they mean at this point. You will want to be comfortable with them by the time we get to a full model.

Consider this put: K=7. S=10. The spot can either become $3 or $17 using the same assumptions about changes in the spot that we made for the call option valuation above. Let’s check out the total valuation first. If the price goes down to $3, it will be $4 below K, so intrinsic value would be $4. If the price of the stock goes up to $17, the intrinsic value of the option would be $0 because $17>$7. Now, let’s add it up: 50%\*$4 + 50%\*$0 = $2, so the option is worth $2. How much of that is intrinsic value? Well, S>K to start with, so the option starts with no intrinsic value. Therefore, all $2 are from time value. 

A little more terminology before we continue. **The relationship between a strike price and a spot price is called “moneyness.”** Remember how intrinsic value was $0 when the strike was below the spot for a put or above the spot for a call? **Intrinsic value cannot be negative, but moneyness can**. So a call with S = $3 and K = $5 would have a moneyness of $-2. If moneyness is positive, an option is said to be “in the money” or “ITM.” If you’re familiar with the musical *42nd Street*, you can remember this because being in the money is a very good thing. If moneyness is negative, the option is “out of the money”  
  or “OTM.” If moneyness is exactly $0, the option is “at the money” or “ATM.” This terminology will come in handy later when we start talking about actual trades. Let’s test our knowledge so far:

**Question 2:** An option has a moneyness of $-2 and S>K. Is it a call or a put? Answer shown at end of post. Can the option still be worth more than $0? How much of that value would be intrinsic value versus time value?

The relationship between moneyness and intrinsic value results in a special relationship between total option value and the spot price of the underlying.

Thank you for staying with me so far by the way. I know this is a lot.

**Volatility and Option Value**

You may have already noticed that an option’s intrinsic value can be expressed as a function of moneyness. Namely, if moneyness is at least 0, then intrinsic value = moneyness. This idea is powerful because it applies to both puts and calls. 

Now consider that if moneyness is not greater than 0, intrinsic value does not change as moneyness decreases further because it just stays at 0. In other words, whether moneyness is -3 or -10,000, intrinsic value is 0. However, if moneyness is at least 0, then as moneyness increases, intrinsic value increases as we stated before. If we put these two ideas together, we see that **the relationship between moneyness and intrinsic value is asymmetrical around 0. In other words, options have an asymmetric payoff function.**

Now let’s think of this in terms of volatility: all else being equal, a more volatile underlying asset price has more potential to cause an option to expire further in the money or further out of the money. Another way of saying this is that greater volatility leads to a greater chance of a higher absolute value of moneyness at expiration. Since intrinsic value can’t get any lower once it hits 0, higher volatility can raise the maximum intrinsic value an option can have at expiration up to infinity, but cannot lower the minimum intrinsic value below 0. So, under the model we have been using, if an option can already end up with $0 of intrinsic value, volatility can only help option value, not hurt it, from there. Later, when we get to the Black Scholes model, we will see that volatility is virtually always is accretive to total option value, but for now we will stick to easy examples where options have a high potential to expire OTM. 

For the purposes of an example, we’ll introduce one new term; σ (pronounced “sigma”). σ a parameter used to express volatility. Some readers may notice that σ is used to denote standard deviation in statistics. The idea is similar here. For this model, σ will denote the amount by which S can move up or down during the single change that occurs before option expiration. So if S is 0 to start with and can move to 4 or -4, then σ = 4. **Later on, we will express σ as a %, indicating a rate of change, but we are keeping it simple for now.**

Consider a call option with the following parameters using the model we have been using so far: K=25, S=20, σ=10. We know S can end up being either 30 (20+10) or 10 (20-10), which means the intrinsic value of the call will be either 5 (30-25) or 0 (because 10<25), which means that value of the option now is 2.5. 

Now let’s try decreasing sigma to 7. Now S can now be either 27 or 13 at expiration, which means intrinsic value is going to end up being either 2 or 0, which means the option’s value is 1. Notice how lowering σ decreased total option value. 

Now, let’s increase sigma dramatically to 15. S at expiration will either be 35 or 5, so intrinsic value at expiration with either be 10 or 0, which means the total value of the call option is 5. 

Feel free to try this with as many puts and calls as you want. You will observe that as long as the option isn’t so far in the money that S-σ>K for a call or S+ σ<K for a put, an increase in σ can never decrease option value, and as long as S has the potential to change such that the option may expire OTM or ATM, an increase in volatility will always increase total option value.

**Congratulations: you now understand the basic idea of how options prices relate to the volatility of the underlying asset, and you can express it using a simple options pricing model. (It’s a simplified version of the “binomial model” for readers that want to put a name on it.)** 

You may be wondering how markets determine volatility in the first place. When options trade on the market, the value that the options trade for can be used to determine the σ implied by the trade. For example, if we are using the model we’ve used above, a call option worth $3 where S starts at $5 and K is $4, must have an implied σ of $5. No other σ would produce that total option value. 

In the real world, the implied level of volatility is typically expressed as a % and refers to the standard deviation of the change in S over the course of a year. The model used to calculate implied volatility is typically the Black Scholes model, which we can easily learn once we are able to use all 5 variables in the binomial model. The implied value of σ given an option’s price based on the Black Scholes model is called Implied Volatility or “IV”. We will deal with IV more later. For now, just think of it as the market’s best guess at σ. 

The idea of IV does, however, bring up something we can use now; the IV of an option trading on the market is an estimation collectively arrived at by traders. **IV does not necessarily represent how much S will actually change because the market cannot psychically tell the future.** In other words, the market tries to calculate an appropriate value for σ, but often comes up with something that isn’t subsequently reflected in the actual behavior of the underlying. They get it “wrong,” in a way, and if you watch an option for a while, you’ll observe IV constantly changing. 

There is a way to try to make money from this theory: **If you think σ based on the actual future behavior of the stock will be too high or too low to justify the value at which an option currently trades, you may have a trading opportunity.** 

In that light, let’s do our first imaginary trade. To up the ante, **I’ll give gold to the first person who gets this right and posts the answer in the comments:** Let’s say you think the σ of an asset is going to be $10 based on the model we have used in the previous examples. You look at the option chain (the list of options available on the asset), and you see the options below. You decide you are going to buy one option. Which do you buy, and why?

S = $25

**Calls**

K = $35 Price = $1.00

K = $30 Price = $2.50

K = $25 Price = $3.50

K = $20 Price = $5.00

**Puts**

K = $30 Price = $3.50

K= $25 Price = $2.00

K = $20 Price = $1

K = $15 Price = $0.5

***Supplemental:*** 

***Bid Ask Spread:*** *The difference between the highest bid (offer to buy something) and the lowest ask (offer to sell something) is called the “bid ask spread.” The smaller the bid ask spread is, the more trades usually occur because small spreads imply there is less of a disagreement, measurable in price, between buyers and sellers. This small disagreement means only a small change in the bid or the ask is necessary to make a trade happen.* 

***To Whom Do You Buy or Sell When You Exercise an Option?*** *Ultimately, financial responsibility will fall on the person who wrote (originated or originally sold) the option, but your broker and a group called a “clearing house” are the ones who ensure that a transaction actually occurs when you exercise your option. The important thing to remember is that you do not take counter party risk from the person who wrote the option. That is to say, the person who wrote the option can’t simply refuse to honor their agreement and cheat you. If they try, you’ll still get to profit (to the extent appropriate) when you exercise your option because of the clearing house. The writer becomes their broker’s problem (and eventually law enforcement’s problem) – not yours. Keep an eye out for a post about “assignment” or look up “assignment and clearing houses,” for further reading.*

***Answers to Practice Questions***

491,$GOOG: Justice Dept. Plans to File Antitrust Charges Against Google in Coming Weeks,1652,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/im0w0x/goog_justice_dept_plans_to_file_antitrust_charges/,84,"[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/politics/google-antitrust-justice-department.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/politics/google-antitrust-justice-department.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)

Key Excerpts:

&#x200B;

>The Justice Department plans to bring an antitrust case against Google as soon as this month, after Attorney General William P. Barr overruled career lawyers who said they needed more time to build a strong case against one of the world’s wealthiest, most formidable technology companies, according to five people briefed on internal department conversations.  
>  
>Justice Department officials told lawyers involved in the antitrust inquiry into Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, to wrap up their work by the end of September, according to three of the people. Most of the 40-odd lawyers who had been working on the investigation opposed the deadline. Some said they would not sign the complaint, and several of them left the case this summer.

&#x200B;

>Brianna Herlihy, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment on the continuing investigation. Jose Castaneda, a spokesman for Google, said that the company would “continue to engage with ongoing investigations” and that its business practices enabled “increased choice and competition.”

&#x200B;

>The Justice Department amassed powerful evidence of anticompetitive practices, three people said.  
>  
>But the lawyers also described internal politics that at times slowed down the department’s work or drove a wedge among members of the team.

&#x200B;

>For nearly a year, dozens of Justice Department lawyers and other staff members worked in two groups, each overseeing a separate line of inquiry: Google’s dominance in search and its control over many aspects of the ecosystem for online advertising.

&#x200B;

>Google controls about 90 percent of web searches globally, and rivals have complained that the company extended its dominance by making its search and browsing tools defaults on phones with its Android operating system. Google also captures about one-third of every dollar spent on online advertising, and its ad tools are used to supply and auction ads that appear across the internet.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech seems to have picked up with Google in the Trump Administrations crosshairs. Despite broad bipartisan support in Congress and amongst 50 state AGs, there seems to be some politicking, or at least the appearance of such, that could slow down the government's case. AG Barr wants to file charge against Google by the end of September.",2020-09-04 06:58:26

Investor Carl Icahn’s bet on the downfall of brick-and-mortar retailers produced a $1.3 billion gain during the first half of the year.

The profit came from a short position on commercial mortgage backed securities, Icahn Enterprises LP said Monday in a regulatory filing. Icahn’s publicly traded holding company has committed capital to his proprietary investment funds and thus reports on their returns quarterly.

Icahn, 84, began making the bet, frequently called the “mall short,” in mid-2019 by purchasing credit default insurance using CMBX 6, an index highly exposed to shopping mall loans. The likelihood of defaults soared in March as the Covid-19 pandemic led to store closures and prompted more consumers to shop online, accelerating a trend already well underway.",2020-08-25 23:55:32

> Longtime Boeing engineers say the effort was complicated by a push to outsource work to lower-paid contractors.

> The Max software -- plagued by issues that could keep the planes grounded months longer after U.S. regulators this week revealed a new flaw -- was developed at a time Boeing was laying off experienced engineers and pressing suppliers to cut costs.

> Increasingly, the iconic American planemaker and its subcontractors have relied on temporary workers making as little as $9 an hour to develop and test software, often from countries lacking a deep background in aerospace -- notably India.

> Boeing said the company did not rely on engineers from HCL and Cyient for the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which has been linked to the Lion Air crash last October and the Ethiopian Airlines disaster in March. The Chicago-based planemaker also said it didn’t rely on either firm for another software issue disclosed after the crashes: a cockpit warning light that wasn’t working for most buyers.

> Engineers who worked on the Max, which Boeing began developing eight years ago to match a rival Airbus SE plane, have complained of pressure from managers to limit changes that might introduce extra time or cost.

> “Boeing was doing all kinds of things, everything you can imagine, to reduce cost, including moving work from Puget Sound, because we’d become very expensive here,” said Rick Ludtke, a former Boeing flight controls engineer laid off in 2017. “All that’s very understandable if you think of it from a business perspective. Slowly over time it appears that’s eroded the ability for Puget Sound designers to design.”

> Rabin, the former software engineer, recalled one manager saying at an all-hands meeting that **Boeing didn’t need senior engineers because its products were mature.** “I was shocked that in a room full of a couple hundred mostly senior engineers we were being told that we weren’t needed,” said Rabin, who was laid off in 2015.

> Starting with the 787 Dreamliner, launched in 2004, it sought to increase profits by instead providing high-level specifications and then asking suppliers to design more parts themselves. The thinking was “they’re the experts, you see, and they will take care of all of this stuff for us,” said Frank McCormick, a former Boeing flight-controls software engineer who later worked as a consultant to regulators and manufacturers. “This was just nonsense.”

> Boeing has also expanded a design center in Moscow. **At a meeting with a chief 787 engineer in 2008, one staffer complained about sending drawings back to a team in Russia 18 times before they understood that the smoke detectors needed to be connected to the electrical system**, said Cynthia Cole, a former Boeing engineer who headed the engineers’ union from 2006 to 2010.

> U.S.-based avionics companies in particular moved aggressively, shifting more than 30% of their software engineering offshore versus 10% for European-based firms in recent years, said Hilderman, an avionics safety consultant with three decades of experience whose recent clients include most of the major Boeing suppliers.

> With a strong dollar, a big part of the attraction was price. Engineers in India made around $5 an hour; it’s now $9 or $10, compared with $35 to $40 for those in the U.S. on an H1B visa, he said. But he’d tell clients the cheaper hourly wage equated to more like $80 because of the need for supervision, and he said his firm won back some business to fix mistakes.",2019-07-01 08:19:39

**1. Spend less than your cash flow.** Easy enough concept, and it is the number one rule.

**2. Pay yourself first.** When you get your paycheck, set money aside for yourself before any person or company you owe. This will determine whether you move up financially or not.

**3. Every dollar is an investment.** Even if you are going to Disneyland, it is an investment into your personal happiness and an investment into the relationships you are building with your companions. Every dollar you spend must be advancing you in some way. This will fight off instant gratification.

**4. Always expand your knowledge on making financial choices.** You have never learned everything you need to know. I don't care what school you went to. Keep reading, keep learning.

**5. Don't listen to false prophets.** Just as I encourage you to learn more, it is important to tune out of the advice of people who set bad examples. If your dad is 65 years old and still has not retired, you might want to think twice about following his instructions. Instead, listen to high-identity people.

**6. Set yourself up for financial security, don't have your job do it for you.** This is so important, and yet absolutely no one follows this rule. If you get a job, your employer will sit you down with HR, and an unqualified person from HR will give you deferred compensation options. This person is not licensed in financial options, and so cannot legally advise you. Choose your own retirement vehicles, because it is very likely you can hop employers.

**7. Shop for competing prices for everything and never buy anything at full price!** Clothes, car maintenance, insurance. If you are ever paying full price for a service, you are being exploited.

**8. Take care of yourself physically and legally.** Smoking will raise your life and health premiums. Getting a DUI will disqualify you from life insurance all together. This closes doors that can save you from being a slave till the end of your days.

**9.** **Your hourly earnings are important.** Your annual earnings are not. *Someone making $50,000 a year at $500 an hour has more of their time (meaning their life) than someone making $100,000 at $50 an hour.* This is the single most important concept in understanding who is rich and who is not. *Someone is not living an enriched life because they have amassed wealth and material possessions.* ***Someone is living an enriched life because they have the freedom to spend their time how they wish!***",2018-09-30 02:46:12

[SoftBank Group Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/9984:JP) shares tumbled in Tokyo trading after reports that the Japanese conglomerate made substantial bets on equity derivatives amid the surge in technology stocks.

SoftBank shares dropped as much as 5.4%, the most on an intraday basis since April. The stock had gained 33% this year before Monday.

The Financial Times, Wall Street Journal and [Zero Hedge](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QG8ZJIMB2SJO) reported that SoftBank was making massive bets on technology stocks using equity derivatives. The FT labeled SoftBank the “Nasdaq whale” that “stoked the fevered rally in big tech stocks,” though it didn’t include details of any trading. The FT later reported that SoftBank is sitting on trading gains of about $4 billion after founder Masayoshi Son’s bets on equity derivatives, citing people with direct knowledge of the matter.

 The Japanese conglomerate [said in August](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-11/softbank-returns-to-profit-after-record-losses-on-startup-bets) that it was starting a new unit to trade public securities, pushing beyond its traditional base in telecommunications and private startup investments. Bloomberg [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-11/softbank-is-said-to-target-over-10-billion-in-public-investing) in August that SoftBank was targeting investments of more than $10 billion, perhaps tens of billions, and would use financing structures that would allow the company to avoid showing up in public disclosures of shareholding. 

 

The Japanese company’s derivatives strategy has been built over the past few months, the FT cited the people as saying, adding that SoftBank has spent about $4 billion on options premiums focused on tech stocks over that time. SoftBank now has large but unrealized profits, and the trades have been deeply controversial even within SoftBank, the newspaper reported.

SoftBank declined to comment.

The Wall Street Journal reported that SoftBank spent about $4 billion buying call options on stocks, while also selling call options at higher prices.

 

The idea that options buyers [could drive extreme rallies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-04/option-traders-flex-market-muscles-with-focus-on-very-few-stocks) in technology stocks -- and push benchmark indexes to record highs -- would have drawn skepticism in the past. But as call volumes have exploded in stocks such as Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Tesla Inc., analysts are beginning to embrace the theory. They point out that traders could have outsize influence by concentrating their bets on a narrow set of high-profile names while other trading activity is reduced.

“In a world where volumes are distorted by the frantic trading of algos, any real order flows may have surprisingly large impact on prices,” Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities, wrote in a note Tuesday. “By trading options, they leverage their position.”

511,Key Takeaways from the Airbnb IPO filing,1605,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/k1qvku/key_takeaways_from_the_airbnb_ipo_filing/,385,"Hi everyone,

I work as a PM at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends and tech companies. I put this post together to share some key takeaways I had from looking at Airbnb's S-1 filing. If you found this post valuable and would like to read more please let me know. I'm thinking about writing like this more often if it's something people get value from. Thanks

On Monday November 16th, Airbnb filed to go public. While a target IPO price has not yet been set, Airbnb looks to be aiming to raise about $3 billion dollars at an analyst-estimated valuation of $30 billion. This is up from Airbnb's most recent valuation of $18.1 billion in April of this year when it raised a total of $2 billion in debt to cope with the Covid-19 crisis.

Airbnb is a remarkable company. What started in 2007 as 2 friends renting out airbeds in their apartment to attendees of a conference has, 13 years later, grown into a company operating in 220 countries with over 4 million hosts who have cumulatively earned over $110 billion. In 2019, there were 327 million nights and experiences booked on Airbnb. Nobody could have predicted those numbers in 2007. Airbnb has defined a brand new travel category and become a standard part of our vocabulary, much like Zoom. As they state in their S-1:

>*"" “Airbnb” has become synonymous with one-of-a-kind travel on a global scale.""*

But, while Airbnb is clearly a remarkable company, is it a good investment? That’s the question that this post aims to answer. Here are some key takeaways from an analysis of Airbnb’s recent S-1 filing:

(\****Note:*** *In case you’re wondering, an S-1 is the document that a companies files with the SEC when they plan to go public)*

1. Airbnb is a resilient business

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on Airbnb’s business. Gross booking value (GBV) in March was down 127%. Due to cancellations and alterations, Airbnb actually lost money on bookings in March. However by August, GBV was only down 14% when compared to August 2019. This impressive recovery shows how strong Airbnb’s business is.

For the 9 months ending September 2020, Airbnb posted a revenue drop of 32% when compared with the first 9 months of 2019. While this is a concern, the cut to sales and marketing expenditure at the same time points to a business that is quite resilient - In the same time period that revenue dropped by 32%, Airbnb cut its sales and marketing spend by a massive 54%. The ability to cut sales and marketing spend by over half while only having a revenue drop of 32% (in the middle of a pandemic) points to a business that is highly resilient with strong brand and customer loyalty.

2. Post-Covid travel patterns may benefit Airbnb

If we compare the gross nights and experiences booked on Airbnb to Airbnb’s gross booking value (GBV), we see an interesting pattern. Gross bookings in August are down 28% YoY while GBV is only down 14%. This means that the average spend on an individual booking has actually trended up this year! To further validate this point, long-term stays were down only 13% this year, compared to 81% for short-term stays. There was actually YoY growth for long-term stays from May to September. The importance of long-term stays is highlighted by the quote below:

>*“We believe the long-term stays category represents a different use case than leisure travel, and as a result, was not as impacted as dramatically by COVID-19.”*

Long-term stays are a distinct competitive advantage for Airbnb and if trends continue they could drive a lot of long-term growth.

Airbnb has also highlighted a number of other categories that have performed particularly well this year. In particular, ‘domestic travel’, ‘short-distance travel’ and ‘travel outside top 20 cities’ have performed very well. For example, short-distance travel grew a whopping 38% YoY in September.

No doubt these trends will reverse somewhat as we exit the pandemic. However, it is unlikely they will reverse fully. If these trends maintain decent momentum, they represent a shift in travel patterns that uniquely benefits Airbnb and provides a significant competitive advantage.

3. Strong customer retention and brand loyalty

One of the most striking figures from the S-1 is that 91% of Airbnb’s traffic is organic, coming from direct and unpaid channels. This is very impressive. Airbnb has built an incredible brand and clearly has strong brand loyalty.

>*“Our strategy is to increase brand marketing and use the strength of our brand to attract more guests via direct or unpaid channels and to decrease our performance marketing spend relative to 2019.”*

Customer engagement and retention are also impressively high on the platform. In 2019, 68% of guests left a review of their stay. 69% of revenue generate in 2019 was from repeat guests.

Airbnb also has very strong retention among their host community. In 2019, 84% of revenue came from people who had hosted in 2018. This shows that the majority of hosts are staying on the platform and continuing to earn money through Airbnb.

4. International expansion is a big opportunity

Airbnb’s revenue growth has slowed over the last three years. It grew by 32% in 2019, down from 43% in 2018. While slowed growth is never great, 32% is quite healthy.

It remains to be seen what the impacts of Covid-19 will be on growth over the next few years. However, there seem to be big opportunities for international expansion which would allow Airbnb to maintain (and possibly improve) its growth rate.

Airbnb believes that its total addressable market is a whopping $3.4 trillion. While you can always take these predictions with a grain of salt, it is clear that Airbnb believes that a big part of this market opportunity lies outside the US and Europe. They highlight international expansion as a key part of their long-term growth strategy:

>\*“\****Expand our global network.*** *We plan to expand our global network in the countries in which we already have a deep presence, as well as to expand into markets where our penetration is lower, such as India, China, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and tens of thousands of smaller markets and remote areas around the world.”*

There are some encouraging signs that Airbnb has the potential to grow their international markets. They operate in 220 countries and importantly, 86% of their hosts are outside the US. International markets have also seen an increase in GBV and average nights per booking. In fact, Latin America has the highest average nights per booking of any region, at 4.1 nights. (North America is 3.7)

The strong customer loyalty previously mentioned, significant host presence in international markets (86%) and changing consumption patterns towards longer stays means that Airbnb has the potential to unlock a lot of value as they focus on international markets.

5. Regulation is a big concern

Regulation is a big risk for Airbnb. 70% of the company’s top 200 largest cities (by revenue) have implemented some form of regulation on short-term stays. For example, London has put a 90 nights per year limit on short term stays for properties without specific planning permission to do so.

Airbnb make it clear in the S-1 that the evolving regulatory situation is a cause for concern:

>*“We are subject to a wide variety of complex, evolving, and sometimes inconsistent and ambiguous laws and regulations that may adversely impact our operations and discourage hosts and guests from using our platform, and that could cause us to incur significant liabilities including fines and criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.”*

Airbnb makes sure to point out that they are not dependant on any one city, region or country. For example, the US is the only country that represents over 10% of Airbnb’s revenue. While this may be true, the evolving regulatory environment does not seem to be going in Airbnb’s favour.

Investment Plan

*Please note that this is just an explanation of investing decisions for my personal portfolio and not a recommendation to anyone to buy/sell any stock.*

To make a decision on whether or not to invest in Airbnb, I believe there are 3 important questions to answer:

1. Does Airbnb have good upside potential?
2. What year should conclusions be based on?
3. What is a fair valuation?
4. Does Airbnb have good upside potential?

Although there are regulatory concerns, based on the above analysis I believe that Airbnb has strong upside potential.

2. What year should conclusions be based on?

The Airbnb S-1 is primarily focused on 2019 numbers. Airbnb believes that 2019 figures are the fairest reflection of the strength of the business. They believe that 2020 is a highly irregular year and that the company will rebound quickly post-covid. Investors should come up with their own conclusion on that but I agree with Airbnb that 2019 is a fair reflection of the business.

3. What is a fair valuation for Airbnb?

This is where things get tricky. In some ways, Airbnb doesn’t have any direct competitors to compare against. They are similar to both OTAs (online travel agents) and hotel chains like Hilton but obviously quite different in a number of ways too.

In my opinion, an interesting comparison is with Uber. While not exactly the same, Airbnb and Uber have a lot of similarities. They are both semi-marketplaces (Airbnb is closer to a true marketplace). Uber connects drivers with riders while Airbnb connects hosts with guests. They have a similar business model in that they both take a % of each transaction on their platform.

Obviously there are quite a few differences. In particular, Uber drivers are far more commoditised than Airbnb hosts. Uber also has more direct competition (Lyft).

Looking at 2019 figures for the fairest comparison, Uber is currently priced at roughly 6.33 times 2019 revenue. If we go with the analyst expected valuation of $30 billion, Airbnb would be valued at roughly 6 times 2019 revenue. Uber grew revenue 26% YoY in 2019 while Airbnb grew 32%.

With all of this in mind and particularly considering that Uber’s model is less defensible, I believe that the analyst-estimated $30 billion valuation represents a very good price for Airbnb.

What’s my plan?

My plan is to wait and see what happens on IPO day. If analysts are wrong and the stock pops above $40/50 billion, I won’t be purchasing and will wait to see what Airbnb’s performance is like over the next few months. If the stock settles at or below $30 billion, then I will definitely be adding it to my portfolio.

In other words, in the third quarter alone, it had to figure out how to manage the equivalent of a more than a year’s worth of growth. And that’s after experiencing a huge sales increase in the second quarter.

&#x200B;

1. DO NOT LISTEN TO PEOPLE LIKE STEVEN DUX. Every person in the financial industry has an objective one way or another. Why do you think they keep playing up the fact that they're rich but ask you to participate in their courses or ""learn their secrets"" for a couple thousands of your hard-earned cash? Because they want to take advantage of your inexperience and sell you something that seems grand but is usually something that you can Google or learn easily on your own. There are no ""industry trade secrets"" in investing; if there were, a lot more people like these ones offering you such ""secrets"" would be billionaires and wouldn't bother trying to ""teach"" you something that you don't know.

&#x200B;

2. Take information from a variety of resources. Don't take anyone's offer in selecting ""stocks"" for you that will make you rich overnight. These are tremendous red flags because investments are a deeply personal choice. You invest in companies that you believe in and that YOU think will do well. If all he/she does is offer you a plan that is obscure in where you're putting your money or promises instant wealth with ""unicorn"" companies, they will run with your money. Do your research, learn basic financial concepts from places like Investopedia, and find companies that you truly think will stand the test of time and will grow. Think about it: would you want to throw all your funds at ""tried and tested"" companies like Exxon because some investment guru said it's the best choice (but you personally disagree with or think is going to fail in the future), or invest in a company like Patagonia (ethically respectable, well-known, and trusted) or Google (world-renowned and used, not the best ethically but you know that no one's going to give up their search engine in a long, long time) that you trust for the medium-long term?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Make your own decisions and learn things for yourself one step at a time instead of placing your trust and funds into the hands of another. It'll pay off in the long run, I guarantee it.",2020-10-04 13:36:49

The stock bounced around in extended trading after Amazon provided a wide guidance range for the fourth quarter.

* **Earnings:** $12.37 vs $7.41 per share expected, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv
* **Revenue:** $96.15 billion vs $92.7 billion expected, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv

Amazon  said sales in the fourth quarter will be between $112 billion and $121  billion, which comes out to growth of 28% to 38% from a year earlier.  Analysts were expecting revenue of $112.3 billion. 

The company  forecast operating income of $1 billion to $4.5 billion, assuming about  $4.0 billion of costs tied to COVID-19. That's a step up from the second quarter,  when Amazon said it would spend more than $2 billion on  coronavirus-related measures, including procuring personal protective  equipment, enhanced cleaning of its facilities and wage increases. 

Amazon  continues to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic, as  consumers flocked to the site for essential goods, groceries and  household items. Amazon is expected to face even greater demand heading  into the holiday season, with shoppers likely to do the bulk of their  gift buying online instead of making trips to the store.

""We're  seeing more customers than ever shopping early for their holiday gifts,  which is just one of the signs that this is going to be an unprecedented  holiday season,"" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement.

Bezos  also touted Amazon's recent job creation and treatment of warehouse  workers, which has been a subject of scrutiny in recent months. The  Amazon CEO pointed to Amazon's $15 minimum wage and challenged other  large employers to ""make the jump to $15.""

Amazon is one of few companies that has continued to grow its headcount  amid a broader economic downturn due to the coronavirus crisis. The  company now counts more than 1.12 million full-time employees across the  globe, an increase of 50% year over year. That figure doesn't include  Amazon's network of contractors and temporary workers. 

Amazon's cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services, generated  sales of $11.6 billion for the quarter, up 29% year over year and in  line with analysts' estimates, according to FactSet. Operating income in  the segment of $3.54 billion topped estimates of $3.45 billion. The  segment was helped by millions of people working from home.  

The  company's ""other"" category, which is primarily comprised of its  advertising business, saw revenue of $5.4 billion, up 51% year over  year. Subscription services, which includes revenue from Prime  memberships, climbed 33% year over year to $6.58 billion.

Once  again, third-party sales grew more than Amazon's first-party business.  Third-party sales increased 55% year-over-year, while first-party sales  grew 38% year-over-year. Sales fell 10% in Amazon's physical store unit,  which includes Whole Foods Market.

Amazon shares are up 74% this year, the best performance among the five most valuable U.S. tech companies. 

Three of those companies — Apple, Alphabet and Facebook — also reported quarterly results after the bell on Thursday and all exceeded analysts' estimates.

Amazon will hold a call with investors to discuss its third-quarter results starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.

Initial public offerings have been doing extremely well lately, bringing to mind the excesses of the tech bubble in the late 1990s.

Shares in Chinese toymaker Pop Mart International Ltd. jumped as much as 112 per cent in their debut Friday, after home-rental platform Airbnb Inc. closed 113 per cent above its IPO price in New York. JD Health International Inc. surged 56 per cent in its debut Tuesday while DoorDash Inc. soared 86 per cent in on Wednesday.

The FTSE Renaissance Global IPO Index, which tracks the performance of offerings worldwide, is up 82 per cent this year, compared with a 12 per cent gain for MSCI’s all-country equity index. Comparing the current period with the dot-com bubble is hard to do directly because the Renaissance IPO Index didn’t start until 2009, and a Bloomberg index that was around in the dot-com boom became defunct in 2017.

There are some pretty clear similarities between the Bloomberg index versus the S&P 500 in 1998-99 and the Renaissance gauge now, noted Cameron Crise, a macro strategist at Bloomberg. The performance after that in the late 1990s was even more dramatic. If IPOs were to follow the same pattern now, they would have a huge jump still to come -- before a pretty spectacular drop.

“The action in these names is definitely a concern for us,” said Matt Maley, a strategist at Miller Tabak + Co., speaking about the U.S. IPOs.

“However, we’d also note that experience tells us that froth in the IPO market tends to be a ‘leading indicator’ for an important top -- not an ‘immediate indicator’ of a top. In other words, yesterday’s action in the IPO market probably tells us that we’ll see a meaningful correction at some point over the next six to nine months, not necessarily over the next few days/weeks.”",2020-12-12 02:14:22

In fact, if they lumber up to ask me what I do for a living, and I answer, “I manage an equity mutual fund,” they nod politely and wander away. 

If they don’t wander away, then they quickly change the subject to the Celtics game, the upcoming elections, or the weather. Soon they are talking to a nearby dentist about plaque.

When ten people would rather talk to a dentist about plaque than to the manager of an equity mutual fund about stocks, it’s likely that the market is about to turn up.

**In stage two**, after I’ve confessed what I do for a living, the new acquaintances linger a bit longer—perhaps long enough to tell me how risky the stock market is—before they move over to talk to the dentist. The cocktail party talk is still more about plaque than about stocks. The market’s up 15 percent from stage one, but few are paying attention.

**In stage three**, with the market up 30 percent from stage one, a crowd of interested parties ignores the dentist and circles around me all evening. A succession of enthusiastic individuals takes me aside to ask what stocks they should buy. 

Even the dentist is asking me what stocks he should buy.

Everybody at the party has put money into one issue or another, and they’re all discussing what’s happened.

**In stage four,** once again they’re crowded around me—but this time it’s to tell me what stocks I should buy. Even the dentist has three or four tips, and in the next few days I look up his recommendations in the newspaper and they’ve all gone up.

539,Disney says its ‘primary focus’ for entertainment is streaming — announces a major reorg,1570,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ja3gzj/disney_says_its_primary_focus_for_entertainment/,189,"Disney is restructuring its media and entertainment divisions, as streaming becomes the most important facet of the company’s media business.

On Monday, the company revealed that in order to further accelerate its direct-to-consumer strategy, it would be centralizing its media businesses into a single organization that will be responsible for content distribution, ad sales and Disney+.

Shares of the company jumped more than 5% during after-hours trading following the announcement.

The move by Disney comes as the global coronavirus pandemic has crippled its theatrical business and ushered more customers toward its streaming options. As of August, Disney has 100 million paid subscribers across its streaming offerings, more than half of whom are subscribers to Disney+.

“I would not characterize it as a response to Covid,” CEO Bob Chapek told CNBC’s Julia Boorstin on “Closing Bell” on Monday. “I would say Covid accelerated the rate at which we made this transition, but this transition was going to happen anyway.”

“We are tilting the scale pretty dramatically [toward streaming],” Chapek said on “Closing Bell,” noting that the company is looking at all investments, **including dividends**, as it seeks to increase its spend on new content. Chapek said the board of directors will have the final say on Disney’s dividend payouts.

Only last week, activist investor Dan Loeb called on Chapek to end the company’s annual $3 billion dividend to divert more capital to new Disney+ content.

Loeb’s Third Point Capital is one of Disney’s largest shareholders and bought more shares earlier this year in support of Disney’s repositioning around Disney+, its flagship subscription streaming service.

Loeb told CNBC, “We are pleased to see that Disney is focused on the same opportunity that makes us such enthusiastic shareholders: investing heavily in the DTC business, positioning Disney to thrive in the next era of entertainment.”

Chapek said the reorganization could result in some reduction of staff, but not likely at the same scale as was seen at the company’s parks division last month. Disney was forced to lay off around 28,000 workers after it became clear that its Disneyland parks in California would not be reopening soon.

As part of this reorganization, Disney has promoted Kareem Daniel, the former president of consumer products, games and publishing. He will now oversee the new media and entertainment distribution group.

He’ll be in charge of making sure streaming becomes profitable, as the company continues to invest heavily in its various streaming products. Daniel will hold the reins to all of the company’s streaming services and domestic television networks, including all content distribution, sales and advertising.

Disney is becoming more reliant on Disney+ as movie theaters have been unable to recover after being shuttered in March due to the outbreak. Ticket sales have been particularly lackluster at domestic cinemas since the industry attempted a large-scale reopening in late August.

In recent months, the company pushed back a number of its theatrical releases including its Marvel blockbuster “Black Widow.” The much anticipated Pixar film “Soul” has also been postponed. It will now arrive on Disney+ in December.

Analysts are still awaiting word from Disney about how “Mulan” fared after Disney removed it from theatrical release and sold it through Disney+ for $30. It is expected the company will share more details about its performance during its next earnings report in November.

Daniel will be responsible, in part, for making big decisions about Disney’s theatrical and streaming release schedules going forward.

″[Consumers] are going to lead us,” Chapek said on “Closing Bell.” “Right now they are voting with their pocketbooks, and they are voting very heavily toward Disney+. We want to make sure that we are going the way the consumers want us to go.”

**Reorganizing Disney’s media business**

Alan Horn and Alan Bergman will remain in charge of the company’s studios, Peter Rice will continue to head the company’s general entertainment group, and James Pitaro will stay as head of the company’s sports content.

All will report directly to CEO Bob Chapek. The company’s parks, experiences and products segment will remain under the leadership of Josh D’Amaro, and Rebecca Campbell will remain on as the chairman of direct-to-consumer and international operations. Campbell will report directly to Chapek for all things related to international operations but will report to Daniel when it comes to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+.

“Given the incredible success of Disney+ and our plans to accelerate our direct-to-consumer business, we are strategically positioning our Company to more effectively support our growth strategy and increase shareholder value,” Chapek said in a statement announcing the reorganization. “Managing content creation distinct from distribution will allow us to be more effective and nimble in making the content consumers want most, delivered in the way they prefer to consume it.”

Under Horn and Bergman, the studios segment will focus on creating content for theatrical release, Disney+ and Hulu. Walt Disney Studios, Marvel Studios, Pixar Animation Studios, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures all fall under their purview.

Rice’s general entertainment segment includes 20th Television, ABC Signature and Touchstone Television, ABC News, Disney Channels, Freeform, FX and National Geographic.

As for Pitaro’s sports segment, that will focus on live sports programming, sports news and original and nonscripted sports-related content across ESPN, ESPN+ and ABC.

Daniel’s media and entertainment distribution group will manage all distribution, operations, sales and advertising across the three content groups. Daniel has spent 14 years with the company in a variety of positions. He helped transform Disney’s Star Wars property into the two Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge lands in Disney World and Disneyland as well as aided in bringing Toy Story Land, Pixar Pier and Avengers Campus to the parks.

“Kareem is an exceptionally talented, innovative and forward-looking leader, with a strong track record for developing and implementing successful global content distribution and commercialization strategies,” said Chapek.

This new structure is effective immediately. The company currently expects to transition its financial reporting to reflect these changes beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.

Additionally, Disney announced that it will hold a virtual investor day on Dec. 10.

Per Moderna's President Stephen Hoge: ""We're not interested in using that IP to decrease the number of vaccines available in a pandemic"". 

**Why does this Matter?**

This is an enormous development for the efforts being made by other companies and governments across the globe. Moderna will not be blocking further advances made by other firms due to proprietary information.   


Investors have reportedly been inquiring about what Moderna had been planning to do with the patents for quite some time. Moderna executives found it important to notify both investors and the greater public that pharmaceutical firms will be working together to address the COVID-19 pandemic as efficiently as possible.   


This is obviously a positive sentiment for the greater market. The sooner pharmaceutical companies mass-produce an effective vaccine, the sooner we can enter economic recovery.

Hertz’s shares rose to $5.53 earlier this week, a nearly 10-fold increase over their closing price of 56 cents following the company’s May 22 bankruptcy filing.

Now the company is asking a bankruptcy judge to approve a deal with Jefferies LLC to allow the potential sale of 246.8 million unissued shares.

“The recent market prices of and the trading volumes in Hertz’s common stock potentially present a unique opportunity” for the company to raise capital on more favorable terms than the strings-attached loans that many other bankrupt companies get, the company’s lawyers said Thursday.

The price of Hertz stock has fallen from this week’s earlier high, closing Thursday at $2.06 a share, but the company said its stock is still actively traded.

Jared Ellias, a law professor at the University of California Hastings College of Law, said he has studied hundreds of bankruptcies and never seen a company try to fund a case with an equity offering at the start of chapter 11.

“Hertz looks at the market and sees there is a group of irrational traders who are buying the stock, and the response to that is to seek to sell stock to these people in hopes of raising some amounts of money to fund their restructuring,” Mr. Elias said.

Hertz shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange, which has moved to delist the company. Hertz has appealed the NYSE notice of delisting. Shares of bankrupt companies are typically worthless, save for rare instances in which the debt is repaid in full and money is left over for equity holders.

The shares would have to sell for more than $4 each for Hertz to hit $1 billion.
Hertz’s roughly $3 billion in corporate bonds were trading earlier this week at around 40 cents on the dollar, indicating little faith among creditors they will be repaid in full.

A Hertz spokesperson wasn’t immediately available for comment.

They're simply bait for people to express their political views under the veil of markets.  Without fail every time we have one of these threads someone gets banned for political attacks and the whole thing gets shut down.  

Obviously policy impacts markets, and we have to be appreciative of people's differing (civil and thoughtful)views on policy so topics concerning specific policy initiatives will still be allowed but they must be clearly and obviously tied to investing.  The policy must also be flushed out and have a reasonable chance of becoming law.  This means ""what happens to markets if we get universal Healthcare"" or ""what would a wealth tax do"" isn't acceptable.  You would need to have something more specific such as ""what is the risk to insurance stocks under proposed law XYZ"".  Basically all of this comes down to effort: if the question looks like a low effort fishing expedition for a political argument it'll be taken as such.  If OP displays a specific understanding of the topic and displays effort to directly relate to investing then that should absolutely be allowed. 

Under these guidelines policy proposals from candidates are going to come under extra scrutiny.  In the financial world we are concerned with probabilities and within that context proposals that are unlikely to ever make it beyond campaign speeches are going to be pretty heavily restricted.  What I mean by that is if Sanders or Warren mention a wealth tax ""what happens if we get a wealth tax"" isn't a thread that needs to happen here.  I think we're all willing to be flexible on topics here but the further away something is from reality the less it needs to be a topic here.  

Here's an example: Last month the Secure Act made it's way in to a budget bill.  This is the largest change to retirement plan rules since the pension protection act of 06.  There were two threads on this topic with aggregate upvotes of less than 10.  Any given low effort question concerning a current candidate makes it to the front page in minutes.  I'll be honest, I feel like we as mods have not done a good job when real world policy that impacts everyone is not a hot topic here but hypothesizing how legislation that doesn't exist is.  So with that context in mind we're going to be taking the aforementioned steps to remove some of the threads that are thinly veiled attempts to talk general politics.

That said, one further clarification: this does not extend to any sort of research, white papers, etc concerning said policy and markets.  Goldman publishes their thoughts on how universal health care would impact different sectors?  Absolutely post it up.  A study of equity performance under new taxation in other countries?  Go for it.  You want to ask what happens to stocks if the US has a communist revolution?  Kindly do so in /r/politics. 


the rules on the sidebar will be adjusted to reflect this shortly.  Feel free to provide feedback on specifics here, we're pretty set on the general direction but always open to subscriber feedback. 

Also one last note: we need to expand the mod team, we're all busy and there's a consistently increasing amount of rule breaking behavior.  In the past we've done so organically by selecting regulars with good history of contributing to be mods.  That will probably hold true going forward as well - IMO appointing mods that aren't longstanding contributors is how you end up with subs like /r/economics.  So if you're interested throw your name in the hat, I can't promise anything and if we don't recognize your username it's highly unlikely you'd be selected but I'd like to cast a line and see what hits.

Alex Karp, the co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), spoke via teleconference on December 3 with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis about Palantir’s ever-expanding partnership with the government of Greece to support their COVID-19 response efforts. Dr. Karp and Prime Minister Mitsotakis were joined by Palantir Executive Josh Harris and Kyriakos Pierrakakis, Minister of Digital Governance of Greece, to explore new ways to keep Greece ahead of the curve with their public health response.

Since the start of the pandemic, Palantir has worked with the Greek government to help enable data-driven decision-making in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic response. The government is leveraging Palantir’s Foundry software platform on top of Amazon Web Services infrastructure to deliver COVID-19 response workflows to government officials responding to the pandemic. Of particular value has been the deployment of a crisis-control center dashboard for the Prime Minister, which displays a holistic overview of the state of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece in real time.

“Our partnership with the Greek government was borne out of necessity once the pandemic began,” said Alex Karp, co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies. “We have readily played a key role in their COVID-19 response effort, which from our experience has been one of the best in the world, and we look forward to broadening this partnership for years to come.”

The Ministry of Digital Governance, leading Greece’s rapid digital transformation, played a pivotal role in facilitating the partnership swiftly, enabling top decision makers to start generating actionable insights within a matter of days. As the pandemic continues to evolve, Palantir will deliver advanced integration and analytic capabilities to a range of government initiatives, to enable data-driven decision-making.

-	Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were looking for a decline of 34.7%.

The U.S. economy saw the biggest plunge in activity it has ever known in the second quarter, though it wasn't quite as bad as feared.

Gross domestic product from April to June plunged 32.9%, according to the Commerce Department's first reading on the data released Thursday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a drop of 34.7%.

Still, it was the worst drop ever, with the closest previously coming in mid-1921.

Sharp contractions in personal consumption, exports, inventories, investment and spending by state and local governments all converged to bring down GDP, which is the combined tally of all goods and services produced during the period.

Spending slid in health care and goods such as clothing and footwear. Inventory investment drops were led by motor vehicle dealers, while equipment spending and new family housing took hits when it came to investment.

Prices for domestic purchases, a key inflation indicator, fell 1.5% for the period, compared to a 1.4% increase in the first quarter when GDP fell 5%, The personal consumption expenditures price index dropped 1.9% after rising a tepid 1.3% in Q1. Excluding food and energy, the ""core"" PCE prices were off 1.1%.

However, personal income soared, thanks in large part to government transfer payments associated with the coronavorus pandemic. Current-dollar personal income rose more than six-fold to $1.39 trillion, while disposable personal income shot up 42.1% to $1.53 trillion.

Despite the rise, personal outlays tumbled by $1.57 trillion, due in large part to a drop in services spending.

Not the Great Depression nor the Great Recession nor any of the more than three dozen economic slumps over the past two centuries have ever caused such a sharp drain over so short a period of time.

By comparison, the worst quarter during the financial crisis of 2008 was the 8.4% GDP drop in the fourth quarter of that year. The previous low-water mark was a 10% slide in the first quarter of 1958, while the worst in recorded history came in Q2 of 1921.

This particular tumble in activity owes to a different source than any of its predecessors: a government-induced shutdown aimed at combating Covid-19.

Workers across the country were told to stay home from any job not considered essential, resulting in a crushing halt that saw the unemployment rate peak at 14.7%, a post-Depression high. The National Bureau of Economic Research said the current recession actually started in February, a month before the pandemic declaration. First-quarter GDP fell 5%.",2020-07-30 23:49:55
561,People aren’t fully realizing the economic impact of the Chinese Corona Virus,1526,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/eusz3g/people_arent_fully_realizing_the_economic_impact/,617,"**Disclamer**: This isn’t a fear mongering post about the virus itself. To put it into perspective the Swine Flu epidemic of 2009 has over 110k confirmed cases and close to 4000 deaths in the US alone yet many people don’t even remember that. But that’s for a different discussion in a different sub.

I’m currently in Shanghai now, from my observation people in the West are not spending enough time talking about how devastating this virus has been to the Chinese economy and its certain global ramifications.

Let’s take the city of Shanghai for example. It’s not one of the more heavily impacted cities, it’s not quarantined and people can mostly come and go freely. Many businesses are still open, from restaurants to malls.

However for the first time ever I saw an Apple store with more employees than customers, and an open Starbucks with absolutely zero customers inside. The streets on a Saturday afternoon were about as empty as it would be at midnight on a regular weekday. All of this is happening during what’s supposed to be the  busiest week for consumer spendings in China.

The worst part is this doesn’t seem like it will change any time soon. Shanghai just announced that they will extend the CNY holidays by another week and people will like remain fearful for the coming weeks, if not months if we don’t see a dramatic turnaround of the virus situation.

What this means is that any Western company that relies significantly on China for revenue would see their first quarter earning absolutely *crushed*, especially considering their forecasts were done with the assumption of this quarter being the best quarter of the year. For example I’m foreseeing Apple miss their Greater China’s revenue by as much as 50% this quarter, and it would be even worse for companies like GM, Ford and the airlines. I’m not sure if it’s widely known, but China is GM’s largest market by revenue and Ford’s 2nd largest.

Further more this will impact the global manufacturing and supply chain significantly. I don’t know enough to model out a detailed scenario but my gut feeling tells me a prolonged manufacturing shutdown across major Chinese cities would be more than a little disruptive in that regard.

I’m discounting the impact of the virus if it were spread to other countries in any significant numbers, but even considering the situation in China alone it’s extremely worrying.

One final point is due to the significantly reduced traveling, China’s energy demand for this quarter would also be drastically reduced. It will likely impact global energy/oil prices and cause even further ripple effects.

**Edit**: for people tell me how CNY in Shanghai should make the city a ghost town... Yes a few million migrant workers (流动人口), leave town during this time, but there are still ~~10M~~ 15M local residents left. For them this is a week of shopping, 串门(visiting friends), taking their kids to places since it’s also winter break, etc. I grew up in this city and no, people don’t just spend a whole week of national holidays at home.

But yes... some businesses would be closed until 初四, and it may impact local expats’ favorite bars and clubs...

**Edit 2**: Some people are missing the point. No I’m not saying the 2% drop we had so far is “The Dip”, that’s just normal fluctuation. No I’m not saying you should sell everything because unless the world is ending (in which case you wouldn’t worry about your stocks), the market will bounce back. Hell it bounces back after 2008 stronger than ever. But at this point nobody knows just exactly how bad the damage would be and how long it would last, so it *will* be rocky in the short to medium term. No you don’t have to react but you also shouldn’t be surprised if the market does.

**Edit 3**: Jesus Christ people before you tell me how people tend to stay home and do nothing for Chinese New Year, I've spent 20+ CNY here as a local and that's just wrong. Last year people spent [$150B USD](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-10/china-lunar-new-year-holiday-retail-catering-sales-up-8-5-cctv) during CNY in consumer spendings. Chinese movie box office during the six days of CNY in 2019 [reached $860M USD](https://variety.com/2019/film/news/piracy-wandering-earth-chinese-new-year-1203138142/), which is probably more than any weekly box office number from the U.S. in all the history of Hollywood, but this year all movie theaters are closed due to the virus.

* * *

Shortly after Apple slashed its revenue guidance for the first quarter, Goldman Sachs said the iPhone maker will likely have to bring down numbers for the full year. As those results drop further, so will the company's shares, the firm said.

""We see the potential for further downside to FY19 numbers depending on the trajectory of Chinese demand in early 2019,"" wrote Goldman's Rod Hall in a note to clients late Wednesday.

The company sees first-quarter revenue of $84 billion vs. a previous guidance of a range of $89 billion and $93 billion. Analysts expected revenue of $91.3 billion for the period, according to the consensus estimate from FactSet. Apple blamed most of the revenue shortfall on a slowing economy in China in the second half.

Apple shares dropped more than 9 percent to $143.70 in premarket trading after ending the first day of 2019 at $157.92. And Goldman's Hall slashed his 12-month forecast to $140 from $182. He also lowered his full-year 2019 revenue estimate by 6 percent to $253 billion and his full-year EPS estimate by 10 percent to $11.66.

Nokia comparison
""We have been flagging China demand issues since late September and Apple's guidance cut confirms our view,"" wrote Hall. ""We do not expect the situation to get better in March and would remain cautious on the region.""

But the analyst went further, comparing Apple to the fallen phone maker Nokia, which became reliant on customer upgrades in the face of a saturated market more than a decade ago. Customers delayed replacing their phones for longer and longer as economy slowed, Goldman notes.

I do data-driven short-term trading via a homegrown system, and I got burned by brokerage behavior I hadn't known was possible.

So, last month my system told me to short INNT from to June 18th to July 16th.  I opened a short position on 1420 shares (\~$15k at about $10.55 per share) on 6/18.  Unfortunately, INNT saw a massive spike (>100%) not long after I opened my position, presumably triggered by it getting added to the Russell 3000, 2000, and Microcap indexes.  Not great news, but I didn't panic and close the position -- I would stick it out through the frenzy out and follow the plan.

On July 11th, I got a surprise -- my brokerage had forcibly closed out my position, buying back the shares at a cost of about $35k.  It turns out that they had to execute a ""buy-in"" with no notice since they suddenly found themselves no longer able to lend me the INNT shares.  Presumably, other clients had sold their INNT shares, and the brokerage now didn't have enough shares for me to continue shorting.

Anyway, July 16th arrives (the date on which I was to close the position), and the share price drops to $8.08 per share.  So, had that forced buy-in not occurred, **I'd have made $3.5k rather than lost $20k.**

Lesson learned: Your brokerage can close your short position without any notice, regardless of your account's standing.  (And yes, I could have limited the loss via options, but that's not practical for my situation)",2018-07-18 04:01:50

I'm 33 and just about to celebrate my 10 year anniversary of being employed. Plan is to retire around 40-45 and then focus on my hobbies. 

I don't bring in a ridiculous salary but have had a high savings rate and good luck with returns. I'm frugal so I can maintain a decent savings rate despite living in a relatively expensive northeast suburb. My rent is $1850 as an example although I split that cost with my Fiancee. 

According to the ss.gov website, my gross income average since I started working has been $70254. I started at $45,000 when I graduated in 2008. It's doubled since then and now I can finally pump more money into individual accounts. It's pretty awesome to have a portfolio that's probably equal to my actual net income after taxes. The power of compounding!

I max out the 401k and Roth IRA each year with index funds. Index funds make up about 65% of my investment income and the rest is individual securities. I've had a great run with some individual picks that have driven results quite a bit(UNH, MKL are my two biggest holdings and I bought a bunch of UNH in the 20s all the way up to the 100s). I actually sold a bunch of UNH when it became too big a part of my portfolio in the 130s and now it soared all the way up to 220. Risk management can sometimes come at the expense of returns but I'd rather not how so much exposure to one stock. Still hold a good portion of their stock though and like the company. I've also played around with options a bit but in a very small way. Again most of my money is in index funds so my overall returns haven't been that far above the S&P 500 although I've eclipsed it a little bit. 

My strategy has been to follow a strict investment plan since I started although I only got serious about tracking my asset allocation closely in the past few years. My investment plan also allows me to hold up to 10% max in cash as part of my portfolio when I can't find any good deals out there. I always have money flowing into the market though via bi weekly 401k contributions. 

I'm pretty amped to get there so early due to the crazy bull market we've had and am not worried if there's a move in the other direction. I'm still likely 10+ years out and plan to keep pumping money in for a while so lower prices are better for me from a long term return perspective. 

Just wanted to say YAY and show everyone that it doesn't take a ton to make things work as long as you're consistent.

“Ladies and gentlemen, we are done. We have a deal,” White House aide Eric Ueland announced at the Capitol just after midnight.

White House officials said the measure will cost about $2 trillion.

Negotiators worked all day, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and incoming White House chief of staff Mark Meadows shuttling between meetings with Republicans and then Democrats.

The package includes direct deposits for all Americans, $367 billion for loans to small businesses and an unprecedented program that will allocate $500 billion to the Treasury Department. Some of that money will be used to guarantee a Federal Reserve loan program for small and medium-size businesses. Larrry Kudlow, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, said the funds could be leveraged into $4 trillion of lending through the Fed.

Most adults would receive direct payments of $1,200, while children would see $500 checks. Hospitals would receive some $150 billion under the deal and small businesses would get $367 billion in aid.

>	NEW YORK (Reuters) - Herbalife Nutrition Ltd will pay $123.1 million to settle criminal and civil charges it bribed Chinese officials in government agencies and media outlets to boost its business in China, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Friday.

>The multi-level marketing company, whose products include dietary supplements, entered a three-year deferred prosecution agreement in which it admitted to conspiring to violate the books and records provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, an anti-bribery law.

>Authorities said Herbalife schemed from 2007 to 2016 to bribe Chinese officials with cash, entertainment, meals and travel to obtain direct selling licenses, reduce government scrutiny and suppress negative coverage by state-controlled media.

>China accounted for 19% of Herbalife’s $4.49 billion of net sales in 2016, up from 7% in 2006, regulatory filings show.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 1.37 million in August and the unemployment rate tumbled to 8.4% as the U.S. economy continued to climb its way out of the pandemic downturn.

The unemployment rate was by far the lowest since the coronavirus shutdown in March, according to Labor Department figures released Friday.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting growth of 1.32 million and the jobless rate to decline to 9.8% from 10.2% in July.

Government hiring helped boost the total, with the growth of 344,000 workers accounting for a quarter of the monthly gain.

The report comes amid a raft of mostly positive economic signals, with retail sales, real estate and manufacturing showing sharp rebounds off their coronavirus lows. Still, economists worry that absent another round of stimulus from Congress, the boosts in activity could be short-lived. August's job gains mean that more than half of those displaced during the pandemic are back at work.",2020-09-04 23:37:06

606,Do NOT buy Hertz (HTZ),1445,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/gyf532/do_not_buy_hertz_htz/,538,"Ok I’ve seen a lot of posts on Hertz. Here’s the thing. If you know my posts, I’m a huge proponent by saying a stock goes up when “there’s more buyers than sellers.”  This is true and applies to a lot of stocks, so you can throw fundamentals, especially in the short term, all out of the window. 

However, Hertz is different. Right now, it is indeed going up because there are more buyers than sellers, like with any stock that goes up short term, but the reason it is different is the bankruptcy is actually an event that will cause the stock to go to 0 or near 0 (if you are lucky) regardless of how many buyers or sellers there are. 

Think of it like an option. An option’s price, directly related to by its IV, is also controlled by buyers and sellers. However, if at expiration it is OTM, it’s worth 0, no matter how many buyers there might be. That’s because theta takes over and it goes to 0 at expiration. 

This is like Hertz. Hertz has an event, when they officially finalize bankruptcy, that will wipe out all equity holders and you can treat this event as an “option expiration for an OTM option.”  So in this case, this stock will go to 0, so if you are buying now you are gonna be completely screwed. If you have Hertz, you should sell immediately next week. 

Look at the Jan leap options. You’ll notice that almost all of the OTM put options are worth similar to their strike price, so it’s pretty much implying that it’s going to 0 in the future. The 1 strike put didn’t even decrease in value despite the stock going up like almost 100%. The bonds are still basically worth nothing. The only thing propping it up is supply and demand and that won’t matter unlike the other stocks since there’s an event that actually will cause the stock to go to 0. 

Now, someone smart here will be like “yea but it can go up in the short term.” Sure it can. But anything can. If you just wanna gamble like that, you should gamble in like an option on one of those highly volatile travel stocks in that case. Because that gamble is strictly more +EV than buying HTZ stock. You can get lucky and maybe get it right one random day, but on average buying HTZ stock is literally the most -EV thing on average you can do right now.

People absolutely should not be buying this stock and you should offload it if you are up on it early next week.",2020-06-08 03:12:19

610,10 Years of Warren Buffett Book Recommendations,1441,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/6qhp6r/10_years_of_warren_buffett_book_recommendations/,69,"I read through the past 10 years of Berkshire Hathaway annual reports.

Each report is well worth reading (and re-reading).

Both Warren Buffett and his business partner Charlie Munger often talk about how much they read.

Munger is famously quoted as saying:
>“In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn’t read all the time – none, zero.”

True to form, each Berkshire Hathaway report mentions a few books worth reading.

While a summer reading list or a “best books of the year” list is nothing new, a book recommendation means something entirely different when it comes from Warren Buffett.

Here are all the books that were recommended from 2006 to 2016 with quotes from the annual report on why Buffett picked each one.

# **2016 Annual Report**

* Shoe Dog by Phil Knight : *“Nike’s Phil Knight is a very wise, intelligent and competitive fellow who is also a gifted storyteller.”*
* Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Celebrating 50 years of a Profitable Partnership (2nd Edition): *“The Bookworm will once again offer our history of the highlights (and lowlights) of Berkshire’s first 50 years. Non-attendees of the meeting can find the book on eBay.”*


# **2015 Annual Report**

* Limping on Water by Phil Beuth: *“An autobiography that chronicles his life at Capital Cities Communications and tells you a lot about its leaders, Tom Murphy and Dan Burke. These two were the best managerial duo – both in what they accomplished and how they did it – that Charlie and I ever witnessed. Much of what you become in life depends on whom you choose to admire and copy. Start with Tom Murphy, and you’ll never need a second exemplar.”*
* Warren Buffett’s Ground Rules by Jeremy Miller: *“A book that will debut at the annual meeting. Mr. Miller has done a superb job of researching and dissecting the operation of Buffett Partnership Ltd. and of explaining how Berkshire’s culture has evolved from its BPL origin. If you are fascinated by investment theory and practice, you will enjoy this book.""*

# **2014 Annual Report**

* Berkshire Hathaway Letters to Shareholders by Max Olson: *""Max Olson’s compilation of Berkshire letters going back to 1965, and he has produced an updated edition for the meeting. We also expect to be selling an inexpensive book commemorating our fifty years. It’s currently a work in process, but I expect it to contain a wide variety of historical material, including documents from the 19th Century.”*
* Where Are the Customers’ Yachts by Fred Schwed: *“In Fred Schwed’s wonderful book, Where Are the Customers’ Yachts’, a Peter Arno cartoon depicts a puzzled Adam looking at an eager Eve, while a caption says, “There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin either by words or pictures.” If you haven’t read Schwed’s book, buy a copy at our annual meeting. Its wisdom and humor are truly priceless.”*
* The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle: *“There are a few investment managers, of course, who are very good – though in the short run, it’s difficult to determine whether a great record is due to luck or talent. Most advisors, however, are far better at generating high fees than they are at generating high returns. In truth, their core competence is salesmanship. Rather than listen to their siren songs, investors – large and small – should instead read Jack Bogle’s The Little Book of Common Sense Investing.”*
* Jim Ling by Chris Tucker, D Magazine: *“Before I depart the subject of spin-offs, let’s look at a lesson to be learned from a conglomerate mentioned earlier: LTV. I’ll summarize here, but those who enjoy a good financial story should read the piece about Jimmy Ling that ran in the October 1982 issue of D Magazine. Look it up on the Internet.”*

# **2013 Annual Report**

* Forty Chances by Howard Graham Buffett
* The Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham: *“And now back to Ben Graham. I learned most of the thoughts in this investment discussion from Ben’s book The Intelligent Investor, which I bought in 1949. My financial life changed with that purchase….Chapter Eight of Ben Graham’s The Intelligent Investor, the chapter dealing with how investors should view fluctuations in stock prices. Immediately the scales fell from my eyes, and low prices became my friend. Picking up that book was one of the luckiest moments in my life.”*

# **2012 Annual Report**

* Tap Dancing to Work: Warren Buffett on Practically Everything by Carol Loomis: *“[Carol Loomis] has been invaluable to me in editing this letter since 1977. She and I have cosigned 500 copies, available exclusively at the meeting.*
* The Outsiders by William Thorndike, Jr.: *“[The Outsiders] is an outstanding book about CEOs who excelled at capital allocation. It has an insightful chapter on our director, Tom Murphy, overall the best business manager I’ve ever met.”*
* The Clash of the Cultures by John Bogle
* Investing Between the Lines by L.J. Rittenhouse
* Unbeatable by Henry J. Cordes: *""Redblooded Husker fans – is there any Nebraskan who isn’t one? – will surely want to purchase Unbeatable. It tells the story of Nebraska football during 1993-97, a golden era in which Tom Osborne’s teams went 60-3.”*

# **2011 Annual Report**

* Jamie Dimon’s Annual Letters: *“One CEO who always stresses the price/value factor in repurchase decisions is Jamie Dimon at J.P. Morgan; I recommend that you read his annual letter.”*
* IBM’s Annual Reports: *“As was the case with Coca-Cola in 1988 and the railroads in 2006, I was late to the IBM party. I have been reading the company’s annual report for more than 50 years.”*
* MiTek by Jim Healey: *“I recommend MiTek, an informative history of one of our very successful subsidiaries. You’ll learn how my interest in the company was originally piqued by my receiving in the mail a hunk of ugly metal whose purpose I couldn’t fathom. Since we bought MiTek in 2001, it has made 33 “tuck-in” acquisitions, almost all successful.”*
* A Few Lessons for Investors and Managers from Warren E. Buffett by Peter Bevelin: *“I think you’ll also like a short book that Peter Bevelin has put together explaining Berkshire’s investment and operating principles. It sums up what Charlie and I have been saying over the years in annual reports and at annual meetings.”*

# **2010 Annual Report**

* Charles T. Munger (Chinese Edition) by Charles T. Munger: *“The Chinese language edition of Poor Charlie’s Almanack, the ever-popular book about my partner. So what if you can’t read Chinese? Just buy a copy and carry it around; it will make you look urbane and erudite.”*

# **2009 Annual Report**

* FRAGILE: The Human Condition by Howard G. Buffett: *“…a volume filled with photos and commentary about lives of struggle around the globe.”*
* Life Is What You Make It by Peter Buffett
* Giving It All Away: The Doris Buffett Story by Doris Buffett: *“Completing the family trilogy will be the debut of my sister Doris’s biography, a story focusing on her remarkable philanthropic activities.”*
* Poor Charlie’s Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger by Charles T. Munger: *Also available will be Poor Charlie’s Almanack, the story of my partner. This book is something of a publishing miracle – never advertised, yet year after year selling many thousands of copies from its Internet site”*

# **2008 Annual Report**

I did not find any book recommendations listed for 2008.

# **2007 Annual Report**

No other recommendations besides Poor Charlie’s Almanack which I’ve included in 2009 since it was again mentioned there.

# **2006 Annual Report**	

* In Seeking Wisdom: From Darwin to Munger by Peter Bevelin


**But wait, there’s more.**

These are just the last 10 years!

I will compile the last 20 or 30 years if a couple of people find the info helpful!",2017-07-31 01:44:49

>Investors who have flooded into the oil markets to bet on a rebound in crude prices are risking big losses, say commodity specialists, as the exchange traded funds they use are swept up in the current market turmoil.  The United States Oil fund, the largest oil ETF known as USO, saw inflows of about $1.5bn last week, as US crude prices hit their lowest levels since the early 2000s on plunging demand.   
>  
>Professional traders said retail investors, in particular, were trying to pick the turning point for oil, betting that the market will recover quickly once coronavirus-fighting measures are eased.  But prices had further to fall. On Monday, West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, crashed below zero for the first time in history, dropping as low as minus $40 as traders dumped the contract for delivery in May. The June contract, where most of USO’s investments currently sit, lost 15 per cent to about $21 a barrel.    
>  
>Investors are not just at risk of placing a wrong-way bet, traders say, as oil contracts do not trade like equities. Instead, they expire monthly so the underlying crude can be delivered to buyers — something specialists fear could be poorly understood by greenhorn investors.  “Investment in ETFs currently harbours high risks to investors who might be tempted to passively invest in oil due to ultra-low prices,” said Michel Salden, head of commodities at Vontobel Asset Management. Losses can occur when tracker funds have to “roll” their exposure when contracts expire, Mr Salden said.     
>  
>If the oil market structure shifts into “contango” — an industry term for when spot prices are trading below contracts for future delivery — then an ETF might have to sell its contracts at the lower price, then buy the next month’s contract at a higher price just to maintain its holdings.  Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank’s head of commodity strategy, said that the largest long-only oil ETFs had seen their net holdings rise by 400 per cent in the past month.   
>  
>These ETFs, he warned, “are predominantly positioned at the front of the futures curve and will be exposed to rolling losses every month until the market fundamentals eventually stabilise”.  That process “could take several months,” he added.  USO was the fourth most actively traded ETF in the US on Monday morning, with more than half a billion dollars changing hands before lunchtime in New York, as the WTI spot price plummeted.    
>  
>**Investors’ move into USO is reminiscent of 2009, when many investors bought the ETF as crude prices slipped to near $30 a barrel, before almost tripling over the next 12 months as the world economy emerged from the depths of the financial crisis. Investors found their ETF returns did not match the oil-price gains, as they had lost a large chunk of their investment each month through the process of rolling contracts.**  The USO fund, launched in 2006, typically absorbs cash from investors when crude prices hit bottom. Inflows previously peaked in early 2009 and in early 2016, just after oil-price crashes. Since March, the number of shares outstanding in the fund has doubled as new cash comes in.  
>  
>As of Friday, the fund held the equivalent of 146.5m barrels of WTI crude futures for June delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a division of CME Group. That was more than a quarter of the total open interest in the contract, exchange data showed.     
>  
>Nymex market rules impose “accountability levels” of 10m barrels equivalent for most US crude futures contracts, above which traders can be ordered to reduce their position. CME declined to comment on whether it had communicated with USO.  The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a government regulator, has proposed a 6m-barrel limit on individual fund positions in US crude on the brink of delivery, but refrained from setting caps for positions in contracts for delivery later on.    
>  
>Some traders say the USO fund is big enough to exacerbate price moves between different contract months as it rolls out of one position and into another. “That definitely can put downward pressure on the market,” said Joe Raia, a former senior executive in energy futures at Nymex and Goldman Sachs.     
>  
>USO announced last Thursday that it was moving 20 per cent of the WTI contracts it holds into later months, in a move widely believed to have been influenced by the blowout in the spread between crude prices.  The position “just got to the size where it makes sense to spread it out,” said John Love, chief executive of US Commodity Funds, which runs the USO fund, on Friday.   
>  
>The USO next rolls its contracts on May 5 to May 8. The fund extended that process to four days early last decade to make it harder for other traders to front-run its moves.  Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer in New York

Ok. So I lied. This post was getting way too long, so I had to split in two (3a and [3b](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hgp05y/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_3b_of_4/))

In the previous posts [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hdft5z/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_1_of_4/) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hdg9xc/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_2_of_4/), I explained how to buy and sell options, and how their price is calculated and evolves over time depending on the share price, volatility, and days to expiration.

In this post 3a (and the next [3b](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hgp05y/how_to_not_get_ruined_with_options_part_3b_of_4/)), I am going to explain in more detail how and when you can use multiple contracts together to create more profitable trades in various market conditions.

Just a reminder of the building blocks:

You expect that, by expiration, the stock price will …

... go up more than the premium you paid → Buy a call

… go down more than the premium you paid → Buy a put

... not go up more than the premium you got paid → Sell a call

... not go down more than the premium you got paid → Sell a put

**Buying Straight Calls:**

But why would you buy calls to begin with? Why not just buy the underlying shares? Conversely, why would you buy puts? Why not just short the underlying shares?

Let’s take long shares and long calls as an example, but this applies with puts as well.

If you were to buy 100 shares of the company ABC currently trading at $20. You would have to spend $2000. Now imagine that the share price goes up to $25, you would now have $2500 worth of shares. Or a 25% profit.

If you were convinced that the price would go up, you could instead buy call options ATM or OTM. For example, an ATM call with a strike of $20 might be worth $2 per share, so $200 per contract. You buy 10 contracts for $2000, so the same cost as buying 100 shares. Except that this time, if the share price hits $25 at expiration, each contract is now worth $500, and you now have $5000, for a $3000 gain, or a 150% profit. You could even have bought an OTM call with a strike of $22.50 for a lower premium and an even higher profit.

But it is fairly obvious that this method of buying calls is a good way to lose money quickly. When you own shares, the price goes up and down, but as long as the company does not get bankrupt or never recovers, you will always have your shares. Sometimes you just have to be very patient for the shares to come back (buying an index ETF increases your chances there). But by buying $2000 worth of calls, if you are wrong on the direction, the amplitude, or the time, those options become worthless, and it’s a 100% loss, which rarely happens when you buy shares.

Now, you could buy only one contract for $200. Except for the premium that you paid, you would have a similar profit curve as buying the shares outright. You have the advantage though that if the stock price dropped to $15, instead of losing $500 by owning the shares, you would only lose the $200 you paid for the premium. However, if you lose these $200 the first month, what about the next month? Are you going to bet $200 again, and again… You can see that buying calls outright is not scalable long term. You need a very strong conviction over a specific period of time.

**How to buy cheaper shares? Sell Cash Covered Put.**

Let’s continue on the example above with the company ABC trading at $20. You may think that it is a bit expensive, and you consider that $18 is a more acceptable price for you to own that company.

You could sell a put ATM with a $20 strike, for $2. Your break-even point would be $18, i.e. you would start losing money if the share price dropped below $18. But also remember that if you did buy the shares outright, you would have lost more money in case of a price drop, because you did not get a premium to offset that loss. If the price stays above $20, your return for the month will be 11% ($200 / $1800).

Note that in this example, we picked the ATM strike of $20, but you could have picked a lower strike for your short put, like an OTM strike of $17.50. Sure, the premium would be lower, maybe $1 per share, but your break-even point would drop from $18 to $16.50 (only 6% return then per month, not too shabby).

The option trade will usually be written like this:

SELL -1 ABC 100 17 JUL 20 17.5 PUT @ 1.00

This means we sold 1 PUT on ABC, 100 shares per contract, the expiration date is July 17, 2020, and the strike is $17.5, and we sold it for $1 per share (so $100 credit minus fees).

With your $20 short put, you will get assigned the shares if the price drops below $20 and you keep it until expiration, however, you will have paid them the equivalent of $18 each (we’ll actually talk more about the assignment later). If your short put expires worthless, you keep the premium, and you may decide to redo the same trade again. The share price may have gone up so much that the new ATM strike does not make you comfortable, and that’s fine as you were not willing to spend more than $18 per share, to begin with, anyway. You will have to wait for some better conditions.

This strategy is called a cash covered put. In a taxable account, depending on your broker, you can have it on margin with no cash needed (you will need to have some other positions to provide the buying power). Beware that if you don’t have the cash to cover the shares, it is adding some leverage to your overall position. **Make sure you account for all your potential risks at all times.** The nice thing about this position is that as long as you are not assigned, you don’t actually need to borrow some money, it won’t cost you anything. In an IRA account, you will need to have the cash available for the assignment (remember in this example, you only need $1800, plus trading fees).

**Let’s roll!**

Now one month later, the share price is between $18 and $22, there are few days of expiration left, and you don’t want to be assigned, but you want to continue the same process for next month. You could close the current position, and reopen a new short put, or you could in one single transaction buy back your current short put, and sell another put for next month. Doing one trade instead of two is usually cheaper because you reduce the slippage cost. The closing of the old position and re-opening of a new short position for the next expiration is called rolling the short option (from month to month, but you can also do this with weekly options).

The croll can be done a week or even a few days before expiration. Remember to avoid expiration days, and be careful being short an option on ex-dividend dates. When you roll month to month with the same strike, for most cases, you will get some money out of it. However, the farther your strike is from the current share price, the less additional premium you will get (due to the lower extrinsic value on the new option), and it can end up being close to $0. At that point, given the risk incurred, you may prefer to close the trade altogether or just be assigned. During the roll, depending on if the share price moved a bit, you can adjust the roll up or down. For example, you buy back your short put at $18, and you sell a new short put at $17 or $19, or whatever value makes the most sense.

**Assignment**

Now, let’s say that the share price finally dropped below $20, and you decided not to roll, or it dropped so much that the roll would not make sense. You ended up getting your shares assigned at a strike price of $18 per share. Note that the assigned share may have a current price much lower than $18 though. If that’s the case, remember that you earned more money than if you bought the shares outright at $20 (at least, you got to keep the $2 premium). And if you rolled multiple times, every premium that you got is additional money in your account.

**Want to sell at a premium? Sell Covered Calls.**

You could decide to hold onto the shares that you got at a discount, or you may decide that the stock price is going to go sideways, and you are fine collecting more theta. For example, you could sell a call at a strike of $20, for example for $1 (as it is OTM now given the stock price dropped).

SELL -1 ABC 100 17 JUL 20 20 CALL @ 1.00

When close to the expiration time, you can either roll your calls again, the same way that you rolled your puts, as much as you can, or just get assigned if the share price went up. As you get assigned, your shares are called away, and you receive $2000 from the 100 shares at $20 each. Except that you accumulated more money due to all the premiums you got along the way.

This sequence of the short put, roll, roll, roll, assignment, the short call, roll, roll, roll, is called the wheel.

It is a great strategy to use when the market is trading sideways and volatility is high (like currently). It is a low-risk trade provided that the share you pick is not a risky one (pick a market ETF to start) perfect to get create some income with options. There are two drawbacks though:

* If the share dropped too much, you are stuck with it.

You will have to be patient for the share to go back up, but often you can end up with many shares at a loss if the market has been tanking. As a rule of thumb, if I get assigned, I never ever sell a call below my assignment strike minus the premium. In case the market jumps back up, I can get back to my original position, with an additional premium on the way. Market and shares can drop like a stone and bounce back up very quickly (you remember this March and April?), and you really don’t want to lock a loss.

Here is a very quick example of something to not do: Assigned at $18, current price is $15, sell a call at $16 for $1, share goes back up to $22. I get assigned at $16. In summary, I bought a share at $18, and sold it at $17 ($16 + $1 premium), I lost $1 between the two assignments. That’s bad.

* If the share goes up too fast, you missed some opportunity for gain, potentially big gains.

You will have to find some other companies to do the wheel on. If it softens the blow a bit, your retirement account may be purely long, so you’ll not have totally missed the upside anyway.

A short put is a bullish position. A short call is a bearish position. Alternating between the two gives you a strategy looking for a reversion to the mean. Both of these positions are positive theta, and negative vega (see part 2).

Now that I explained the advantage of the long calls and puts, and how to use short calls and puts, we can explore a combination of both.

**Verticals**

Most option beginners are going to use long calls (or even puts). They are going to gain some money here and there, but for most parts, they will lose money. It is worse if they profited a bit at the beginning, they became confident, bet a bigger amount, and ended up losing a lot. They either buy too much (50% of my account on this call trade that can’t fail), too high of a volatility (got to buy those NKLA calls or puts), or too short / too long of an expiration (I don’t want to lose theta, or I overspent on theta).

As we discussed earlier, a straight long call or put is one of the worst positions to be in. You are significantly negative theta and positive vega. But if you take a step back, you will realize that not accounting for the premium, buying a call gives you the upside of stock up to the infinity (and buying a put gives you the upside of the stock going to $0). But in reality, you rarely are betting that the stock will go to infinity (or to $0). You are often just betting that the stock will go up (or down) by X%. Although the stock could go up (or down) by more than X%, you intuitively understand that there is a smaller chance for this to happen. Options are giving you leverage already, you don’t need to target even more gain.

**More importantly, you probably should not pay for a profit/risk profile that you don’t think is going to happen.**

Enter verticals. It is a combination of long and short calls (or puts). Say, the company ABC trades at $20, you want to take a bullish position, and the ATM call is $2. You probably would be happy if the stock reaches $25, and you don’t think that it will go much higher than that.

You can buy a $20 call for $2, and sell a $25 call for $0.65. You will get the upside from $20 to $25, and you let someone else take the $25 to infinity range (highly improbable). The cost is $1.35 per share ($2.00 - $0.65).

BUY +1 VERTICAL ABC 100 17 JUL 20 20/25 CALL @ 1.35

This position is interesting for multiple reasons. First, you still get the most probable range for profitability ($20 to $25). Your cost is $1.35 so 33% cheaper than the long call, and your max profit is $5 - $1.35 = $3.65. So your max gain is 270% of the risked amount, and this is for only a 25% increase in the stock price. This is really good already. You reduced your dependency on theta and vega, because the short side of the vertical is reducing your long side’s. You let someone else pay for it.

Another advantage is that it limits your max profit, and it is not a bad thing. Why is it a good thing? Because it is too easy to be greedy and always wanting and hoping for more profit. The share reached $25. What about $30? It reached $30, what about $35? Dang it dropped back to $20, I should have sold everything at the top, now my call expires worthless. But with a vertical, you know the max gain, and you paid a premium for an exact profit/risk profile. As soon as you enter the vertical, you could enter a close order at 90% of the max value (buy at $1.35, sell at $4.50), good till to cancel, and you hope that the trade will eventually be executed. It can only hit 100% profit at expiration, so you have to target a bit less to get out as soon as you can once you have a good enough profit. This way you lock your profit, and you have no risk anymore in case the market drops afterwards.

These verticals (also called spreads) can be bullish or bearish and constructed as debit (you pay some money) or credit (you get paid some money). The debit or credit versions are equivalent, the credit version has a bit of a higher chance to get assigned sooner, but as long as you check the extrinsic value, ex-dividend date, and are not too deep ITM you will be fine. I personally prefer getting paid some money, I like having a bigger balance and never have to pay for margin. :)

Here are the 4 trades for a $20 share price:

CALL BUY 20 ATM / SELL 25 OTM - Bullish spread - Debit

CALL BUY 25 OTM / SELL 20 ATM - Bearish spread - Credit

PUT BUY 20 ATM / SELL 25 ITM - Bullish spread - Credit

PUT BUY 25 ITM / SELL 20 ATM - Bearish spread - Debit

Because both bullish trades are equivalent, you will notice that they both have the same profit/risk profile (despite having different debit and credit prices due to the OTM/ITM differences). Same for the bearish trades. Remember that the cost of an ITM option is greater than ATM, which in turn is greater than an OTM. And that relationship is what makes a vertical a credit or a debit.

I understand that it can be a lot to take in. Let’s take a step back here. I picked a $20/$25 vertical, but with the share price at $20, I could have a similar $5 spread with $15/$20 (with the same 4 constructs). Or instead of 1 vertical $20/$25, I could have bought 5 verticals $20/$21. This is a $5 range as well, except that it has a higher probability for the share to be above $21. However, it also means that the spread will be more expensive (you’ll have to play with your broker tool to understand this better), and it also increases the trading fees and potentially overall slippage, as you have 5 times more contracts. Or you could even decide to pick OTM $25/$30, which would be even cheaper. In this case, you don’t need the share to reach $30 to get a lot of profit. The contracts will be much cheaper (for example, like $0.40 per share), and if the share price goes up to $25 quickly long before expiration, the vertical could be worth $1.00, and you would have 150% of profit without the share having to reach $30.

If you decide to trade these verticals the first few times, look a lot at the numbers before you trade to make sure you are not making a mistake. With a debit vertical, the most you can lose per contract is the premium you paid. With a credit vertical, the most you can lose is the difference between your strikes, minus the premium you received.

**One last but important note about verticals:**

If your short side is too deep ITM, you may be assigned. It happens. If you bought some vertical with a high strike value, for example:

SELL +20 VERTICAL SPY 100 17 JUL 20 350/351 PUT @ 0.95

Here, not accounting for trading fees and slippage, you paid $0.95 per share for 20 contracts that will be worth $1 per share if SPY is less than $350 by mid-July, which is pretty certain. That’s a 5% return in 4 weeks (in reality, the trading fees are going to reduce most of that). Your actual risk on this trade is $1900 (20 contracts \* 100 shares \* $0.95) plus trading fees. That’s a small trade, however the underlying instrument you are controlling is much more than that.

Let’s see this in more detail: You enter the trade with a $1900 potential max loss, and you get assigned on the short put side (strike of $350) after a few weeks. Someone paid expensive puts and exercised 20 puts with a strike of $350 on their existing SPY shares (2000 of them, 20 contracts \* 100 shares). You will suddenly receive 2000 shares on your account, that you paid $350 each. Thus your balance is going to show -$700,000 (you have 2000 shares to balance that).

If that happens to you: **DON’T PANIC. BREATHE. YOU ARE FINE.**

You owe $700k to your broker, but you have roughly the same amount in shares anyway. You are STILL protected by your long $351 puts. If the share price goes up by $1, you gain $2000 from the shares, but your long $351 put will lose $2000. Nothing changed. If the share price goes down by $1, you lose $2000 from the shares, but your long $350 put will gain $2000. Nothing changed. Just close your position nicely by selling your shares first, and just after selling your puts. Some brokers can do that in one single trade (put based covered stock). Don’t let the panic set in. Remember that you are hedged. Don’t forget about the slippage, don’t let the market makers take advantage of your panic. Worst case scenario, if you use a quality broker with good customer service, call them, and they will close your position for you, especially if this happens in an IRA.

The reason I am insisting so much on this is because of last week’s [event](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/young-robinhood-trader-kills-himself-over-730000-loss). Yes, the RH platform may have shown incorrect numbers for a while, but before you trade options you need to understand the various edge cases. Again if this happens to you, don’t panic, breathe, and please be safe.

This concludes my post 3a. We talked about the trade-offs between buying shares, buying calls instead, selling puts to get some premium to buy some shares at a cheaper price, rolling your short puts, getting your puts assigned, selling calls to get some additional money in sideways markets, rolling your short calls, having your calls assigned too. We talked about the wheel, being this whole sequence spanning multiple months. After that, we discussed the concept of verticals, with bullish and bearish spreads that can be either built as a debit or a credit.

And if there is one thing you need to learn from this, avoid buying straight calls or puts but use verticals instead, especially if the volatility is very high. And do not ever sell naked calls, again use verticals.

1) How is it so long, when the long term value of oil is profoundly unlikely to be permanently damaged

625,Why is Intel losing to AMD & people just realized it now?,1420,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hy3mgo/why_is_intel_losing_to_amd_people_just_realized/,528,"Simple answer: [Dr. Lisa Su (how she turns around AMD)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHT5MRky9SA)

When you invest in a company, it's not just the product that's important for the company, but its people and leadership as well. Because ultimately, a corporation is just an organization run by bunch of people, which Elon Musk emphasized this point. A company's leader who has a clear vision for the company will bring its people together and its competitive products to market for the future. You look at the leaders between Intel's and AMD's. One got a Ph.D in electrical engineering and has a firm grasp of where the industry is heading toward, whereas the other person who was previously a CFO just looks at spreadsheets and uses any means to appease the shareholders. How likely would a business major know anything what the semiconductor industry will look like in five years?

Intel has been dominating 90% of the PC market for many years. The company becomes complacent and so do its shareholders' base as the stockholders enjoy their annual dividend payouts. You do that in a highly competitive semiconductor industry, your company will lose value and eventually get abandoned. You have to be constantly innovating to stay ahead, especially in the technology sector because that's just the nature of the industry. This isn't like consumer staples where the market remains static for a long time. A technology company's moat is easily broken if the company doesn't plan out its roll map & product lines for the next five years. A lot investors could tell this became quite apparent at the last Intel's earning report.

This also separates the difference between value investing & growth investing. Value investors look at financial statements of a company to judge how it appears now, whereas growth investors look at a company and make financial projections where the company can potentially go toward for the next several years. Growth stocks will never appear cheap at any current time, because if they do, then by definition they already stop growing. If you're a value investor by heart, I advise stay away from investing into tech stocks if you don't have a firm grasp about their respective, ever-changing industries, because most of them will never make sense to you.

There will be a time to revisit Intel. In my opinion, Intel needs a better leader who has an expertise in the field. Hitherto, AMD will continue to take market shares away from Intel to grow its revenues & earnings, because its leader already planned this out from the last few years. She knew her competitor would have a tougher time catching up in manufacturing the technology. AMD stock is going much higher for the next 2-5 years.

> 
> UBER’s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi once sold UBER as the next Amazon, promising that “cars are to us what books are to Amazon.” Link here. Khosrowshahi, who was Barry Diller’s top salesman for a decade, pitched the taxi-hailing app, repackaged as “rideshare”, as simply the first step on a journey to global domination. UBER would enter and dominate “food delivery, freight, autonomous vehicles, and even buses and bikes”. Later, he added flying cars. By 2023, Khosrowshahi continued, UBER could run the entire transportation network for a city! As recently as UBER's latest 10-K, filed in February, UBER characterized its Freight business as ""revolutionizing"" the freight industry. And now they are simply going to shut it down? None of these promises have ever happened, of course, and with this week's forced retrenchment, likely never will.
> 
> Severe and unsustainable cash losses have forced UBER to ratchet back its strategic ambitions; to raise another $1.0BN of junk bonds at a steep 7.5%, and reduce on-the-books headcount by at least 25%. UBER will likely cut its ""non-core"" businesses, including freight, autonomous vehicles, flying cars, artificial intelligence, and job matching. These businesses, together, were the secret sauce that was to turn a simple and old-fashioned taxi-hailing app into the next big thing, rivaling Amazon in the scope and reach of its operations. These promises were what drew investors as big as Texas Pacific Group and Softbank in at valuations north of $70BN and even promised to approach $100BN - for a business that, in the here and now, is only able to generate revenues of $14BN, with growth slowing sharply, while margins remain massively negative, and billions of cash losses pile up - and that best case was pre-COVID!
> 
> Now, UBER faces a sharply diminished TAM, or total addressable market, as it gives up its ambitions to expand beyond taxi-hailing and food delivery, and major American and international corporations in various industries, including technology, media, real estate, airlines, hotels, and entertainment destinations all prepare us for a world of sharply diminished transportation needs. Where workers will shift to permanently working from home; where international travel will be diminished for years; where even domestic destination travel will face diminished capacity and utilization.
> 
> None of this has yet sunk into the minds of equity market investors.
> 
> THESIS
> 
> Diminution of Total Addressable Market. Uber is likely abandoning its ambitions to be a leader and create a revenue generating business in nearly every area besides its core taxi-hail and food delivery business. These early-non-core businesses, while inchoate and pre-revenue, gave investors hope that UBER was not just an old-fashioned transportation company making use of the latest technology - smartphone apps - but an actual technology company, with the same opportunity for horizontal expansion as Amazon. This hope was among the reasons why a negative cash burn of several billion dollars for a seemingly mundane business could turn into a $59 BN valuation. That hope is gone.

> For its remaining core business, taxi-hail, the world has changed:
> 
> Negative Secular Changes to UBER’s Core Business
> 
> First, we start with the massive secular change we are witnessing in the American workplace. Then, we move on to the lengthy and even semi-permanent changes to restaurants and travel.
> 
> We are witnessing a generational acceleration in work-from-home, in which commuting to and from work is facing the biggest and fastest change in its history. Companies such as Google, Square, and Twitter are preparing for a future in which employees may work remotely – forever. Others such as Facebook, JP Morgan, Citibank, American Express and Microsoft have taken steps in this direction. Employees who commuted to these workplace jobs were often customers of UBER. Many of these customers and their ""rideshare"" business won’t come back. Here is a sampling of recent headlines that will negatively impact UBER - for at least several quarters in some cases, permanently in others:
> 
> First, Twitter. This one is permanent:

> Next, we have Square, also offering permanence:

> Now, we turn to Facebook, who for now, is only planning until the end of the year:

> Now we will shift to the banks, which are not only continuing work from home, but also seeking semi-permanent shifts away from urban centers, another hit to UBER's business:

> These are the thought leaders. We are witnessing a tsunami of potentially permanently lost taxi-hail business for these former commuters. While some of the headlines may say only through 2020, these arrangements are likely to be made permanent in many cases.
> 
> And now, the rest of the ride-share customer universe: the restaurant, travel and leisure industry have been decimated, with full year 2020 volumes estimated to be down anywhere from nearly 20% (fast food) to 40% (hotels) to more than 50% (airlines and certain destination-based entertainment.)

> Throughout the latest strategy retreat, 25% work force reduction, revenue collapse, junk debt capital raise, and multi-billion dollar cash burn, one thing stands out: UBER’s high flying stock, which has surged this week along with the NASDAQ market to a new high for the year of $59 billion, now up 16% on the year. Stated another way, stock buyers have treated COVID-19 and its catastrophic impact on UBER’s revenues and margins as a net positive catalyst. This stands in stark contrast to the many other companies operating in and round UBER’s universe, including hotels, airlines, lodging, office space, and even other “unicorns"".
> 
> We highlight the 2020 changes in valuation of numerous companies that derive revenues from similar underlying strategic drivers as UBER: commuting to work, commuting to airports, commuting to leisure activities, commuting to restaurants and bars, and commuting to vacation. We lay out the year to date equity returns, followed by consensus changes to 2020 forecast revenues. Every data point indicates UBER’s valuation change is completely inconsistent with its related peer group.
> 
> First, we frame UBER’s equity valuation change year to date, along with the consensus expectation for 2020 Revenues, and list how they have changed, showing the January 1, 2020 consensus estimate, followed by the current 2020 consensus estimate.

> As you can see, UBER is up 16% year to date, while its 2020E Revenue expectations have been reduced by 29%.
> 
> 
> 
> Then, we turn to the various comparably impacted industries, as described above. We start with Airlines, as airports are a primary source and destination of UBER customers, and note the average hit to airline valuation has been 66%, while the average expected hit to revenues in 2020 has been 56%.
> 
> 
> 
> Next, we look at Hotels, a common destination and origin for UBER customers, where you can see the average hotel has taken a 39% valuation hit, while the expected revenue decline is 40%.
> 
> 
> 
> Office REITS, which we also use as a proxy of demand for commuting to work, have seen an average 42% decline in valuation, with only a 5% hit to revenues. Here, the financial forecasts are out of sync with the change in valuation. Even the out years look similar. Expect the numbers to come down, significantly.

> 
> And finally, the still-private “unicorns”, who bear much structural similarity to UBER, particularly AirBnB which also was forced to fire 25% of its work force, and to reduce its strategic scope to “core” operations while giving up on growth opportunities. Here, you will see that AirBnB recently took a 52.6% hit to its private market valuation since 2019, and WeWork took a 60% hit to its December 2019 valuation (which was itself an 84% hit to its January 2019 valuation). AirBnB’s CEO also wrote a letter that sounds nearly identical to UBER’s CEO “I’m-sorry-but-you’re-fired, our business is collapsing” letter.
> 
> 
> 
> The overall context should be clear: UBER's entire ecosystem has experienced a volume and valuation collapse compared to UBER's year to date double digit stock price growth. This stock price growth is inconsistent with the underlying data.
> 
> We specifically concede that none of these companies are perfect comparables, but all derive revenues from a similar ecosystem: the home-work-travel-leisure nexus, and their customers must be transported somehow to their offices, their hotels, their airports, and their leisure AirBnB vacations. Together, they paint a picture: UBER’s equity price has largely ignored the reality of a collapsed ecosystem, and is the only related equity that not only has not collapsed, but is actually UP double digits on the year.
> 
> Will UBER’s business come back? Absolutely, some of it will come back. The travel/airline/hotel transport nexus actually has the highest probability of coming back, but the longest lead time. These won’t see even a near-full recovery for several years, in line with forecasts for hotel and airlines revenue. The most at risk revenue is actually related to work commuting: many employers are in the process of shifting to permanent work-from-home arrangements. UBER will never recover this revenue. Much of the work commute revenue IS NEVER COMING BACK. Thus, UBER's TAM has shrunk.
> 
> UBER's Core, or The Remaining Businesses
> 
> What do the taxi-hail, or Rides, and Eats businesses really look like on a stand-alone basis? What are they worth?
> 
> UBER shows a separate revenue and ""adjusted"" EBITDA figure for each of its remaining core businesses.
> 
> Here is a snapshot of historical revenue breakdown:
> 
> As you can see, the Rides business represents 72% of total revenues, and its growth has flat-lined near zero. Now, this included 2 weeks post-COVID shutdown, so we can assume it may have been able to reach a positive low single digit growth number. Eats grew at a low double digit number, and represents around 19% of total revenue.
> 
> EBITDA is not as straightforward, as many adjustments and exclusions are made. What we know with certainty is that the consolidated business produced negative $2.468 billion of EBITDA for the last 12 months. As for segments, UBER shows a positive $2.460 billion of Rides EBITDA, but that excludes more than $4.0 billion of stock-based compensation, and it also excludes more than $2.5 billion of un-allocated corporate overhead. See worksheet below:
> 
> 
> 
> The exclusions are of such a magnitude as to render the supposed $2.46 billion of EBITDA to be nearly meaningless. Could they have generated this without paying out $4.0 billion in stock compensation? Did the $2.5 billion spent on general and administrative, and R&D have any impact on the Rides business? Of course it did. These numbers can no more be excluded than any business can disown its business expenses!
> 
> So we have a 11-year old business whose top line growth has settled in around a low single digit number that currently loses $2.5 billion a year in consolidated EBITDA. Should they cut $1.0 billion of costs, that is helpful, but the enterprise would still be losing more than $1.0 billion on an adjusted-EBITDA basis. The Eats business loses money and remains hyper-competitive. It is likely to continue to lose money for the foreseeable future.
> 
> So where could UBER's EBITDA number go? This is difficult to say. UBER is hoping to break even on an adjusted-EBITDA basis sometime next year. While I am doubtful that will happen, even it it did, we would have a low growth business in a highly competitive market that at some point in the future could grow that break-even EBITDA into a billion or a few billion of EBITDA. What is that worth? We can look at a range, but unless growth suddenly shoots back into the 20% range or higher, its hard to see a slow growing EBITDA in such a simple business with no barriers to entry commanding a double digit EBITDA valuation multiple. Let's call the midpoint 10x. So 10x 2022E or 2023E EBITDA of $1.0 or $2.0 billion is $10 - $20 billion of enterprise value. And remember, that while UBER can shut down much of its non-core growth/upside assets, it can not simply get rid of its $9BN debt pile, including the recently raised $1.0 billion of junk debt that pays a steep 7.5% coupon.
> 
> If we generously ignore the Eats losses, assume net debt in 2 years will be maybe $4 - $6 billion, and the share count remains the same (which is overly conservative), then we are left with the following valuation, which indicates an equity value that ranges from $2 to $11:

632,Goldman Says Stocks Due for 18% Drop After Rally Driven by FOMO,1413,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ghxwi6/goldman_says_stocks_due_for_18_drop_after_rally/,289,"In the equity market, fear of missing out seems to be overshadowing fear of all that’s wrong with the economy. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says pessimism will soon get the upper hand and send the S&P 500 Index down almost 20% in the next three months.

Fiscal and monetary support over the past few weeks of the coronavirus pandemic successfully warded off a financial crisis, but a return to economic normalcy is still a long ways away and investors have gotten ahead of themselves, the bank’s chief U.S. equity strategist, David Kostin, wrote in a report.

Financial, economic and political risks darken the outlook for domestic equities, Goldman warns. The bank cites the lack of flattening in the U.S. infection curve outside of New York, what promises to be a lengthy re-start process, a 50% hit to buybacks in 2020 and the risk of higher corporate taxes and de facto consumption taxes if U.S.-China trade tensions bubble up again.

“A single catalyst may not spark a pullback, but a number of concerns and risks exist that we believe, and our client discussions confirm, investors are downplaying,” Kostin wrote. Goldman says the S&P 500 will probably drop to 2,400 over the next three months before it rebounds to 3,000 by year end.

The index slumped 0.5% Monday to 2,914 as of 9:45 a.m. in New York.


Kostin notes that large swaths of the investor community have failed to cash in on the S&P 500’s 31% surge since its trough on March 23. He points out that most mutual funds have underperformed since the bear market low, with long/short and macro hedge funds posting single-digit returns as a group, and investors may face pressure to chase the rally.

“The ‘fear of missing out’ best describes the thought process,” Kostin said.

Futures positioning shows investors still doubt S&P 500 rebound

But he warns that it’s a risky move. Even with measures of the breadth of the recent rally improving in recent days -- potentially signaling more buy-in on the idea the gains will last -- Goldman Sachs’ sentiment indicator has barely improved since mid-March.

“Skepticism abounds regarding the likelihood the rally will continue,” the strategist writes.

relates to Goldman Says Stocks Due for 18% Drop After Rally Driven by FOMO
Kostin is pessimistic on the outlook for corporate profits, citing frozen growth plans and capital expenditures will drop 27% this year. He points out that the only encouraging driver for earnings is the swelling federal deficit, which in effect acts as substantial support for demand.

Caution on equities may also be warranted in the face of stretched valuations -- to the extent that anything about 2021’s bottom-line outlook can be discerned.

The benchmark U.S. stock gauge trades at 19.5 times the buy side’s estimate of next year’s earnings, Kostin concludes, the highest level since 2002.

633,Activist investor Dan Loeb urges Disney to suspend dividend and redirect the funds to its streaming service Disney+.,1414,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/j7dpsp/activist_investor_dan_loeb_urges_disney_to/,269," **What is Happening?**

Activist investor Dan Loeb is urging Disney to permanently suspend its dividend and use the funds to fuel growth at its streaming service, Disney+. Disney stock traded up 1.64% Wednesday. Loeb's Third Point owns less than 1% of Disney. 

*Activist investors acquire stakes in companies with the intent to bring operational change. Warren Buffett started out as an activist investor.* 

**Why does this Matter?**

Disney's stock is down 16% for the year as amusement parks are still slow to reopen due to restrictions. Also, last week Disney announced that it was laying off 28,000 workers, wiping out about a quarter of its U.S. theme-park workforce.   


Right now the company's only bright spot is Disney+. It attracted more than 60 million subscribers and even won praise from the likes of Netflix CEO Reed Hastings.   


Loeb would like to use the $3 billion Disney dividend to double Disney+'s budget for original content, bring in additional subscribers, lower churn, and boost pricing power. He would also like to see Disney combine Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu, and Star into one powerhouse streaming service. That way Disney could increase pricing and start releasing all movies on the platform, cutting out movie theaters completely.   


**The Takeaway:**   
Initially, it might seem scary to take away that 1.43% dividend yield from shareholders; however, Loeb is not completely crazy. Dividends are just one way a company can choose to ""allocate capital/profits"". As Loeb correctly points out, times are changing in the entertainment sector and Disney should capitalize on that by redirecting dividends to this high growth project. In the long-run, such a capital allocation decision might just reward shareholders a lot more than the 1.46% dividend. ",2020-10-09 01:10:21

As the result, Sony will have to cut its PS5 production by 26.7%. As we know, AMD provides those SOC chips (custom 8-core AMD Zen 2 CPU and custom GPU based on AMD’s RDNA 2 architecture), and those chips are manufactured with TSMC 7nm process.

Since AMD's upcoming Zen 3 and Big Navi also use TSMC 7nm, will there be yield issue for Zen 3 and Big Navi too? Probably yes.

Will this cause AMD and TSMC stocks to drop? Maybe.

If we keep seeing news like this coming out in the next few weeks, obviously it's not good for any of these companies. So take this into consideration for your next play - don't just YOLO thinking the market has finally turned around.

KEY POINTS
Congress reached a deal Sunday on a $900 billion coronavirus relief package, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Lawmakers will move to vote on the proposal, along with a full-year government spending bill, as soon as Sunday night.
Millions of Americans have awaited aid for months as Congress failed to agree on another plan to boost a health-care system and economy buckling under the weight of the pandemic.

Congress reached a deal Sunday on a $900 billion coronavirus relief package, a long-delayed effort to boost an American health-care system and economy buckling under the weight of the pandemic.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced the agreement on a pandemic aid and full-year government spending bill. He did not delve into many details. Congressional leaders have not yet released text of the more than $2 trillion legislation, which they hope to pass in the coming hours.

The agreement follows months of sniping on Capitol Hill over how best to fight a once-in-a-century crisis. A new round of aid cannot come soon enough for the millions of Americans who have tried to scrape together enough money to afford food and housing.

The $900 billion coronavirus relief plan under negotiation on Capitol Hill was set to include direct payments of $600 to many adults. Some families were also expected to get $600 per child.

The proposal was set to put at least $300 billion into small business assistance including Paycheck Protection Program loans. It would also add a $300 federal unemployment supplement and temporarily keep in place pandemic-era programs that expanded unemployment insurance eligibility.

If those provisions expire the day after Christmas, 12 million people will lose unemployment benefits.

The measure was also set to put critical funding into the distribution of the two FDA-approved Covid-19 vaccines. Health-care workers and top government officials have started to receive shots, and widespread inoculation in the coming months will help the world to emerge from the pandemic’s shadow.

The rescue package was also set to send relief to hospitals, many of which have struggled to keep up with a flood of Covid-19 patients. It was also expected to put new money into education and transportation.

As lawmakers finally reach a deal, the help comes too late for the nearly 8 million people estimated to have fallen into poverty since June. Many in Congress say the proposal will not go nearly far enough to address the scope of the health and economic crisis.

Progressives and some Republicans have pushed for larger direct payments and retroactive federal unemployment payments. A $600 weekly supplement that buoyed millions of jobless Americans in the early months of the pandemic expired over the summer, and it took Congress months to agree to reinstate it.",2020-12-21 10:00:10
642,Todays Negative Oil is Economically Devastating,1399,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/g53z9h/todays_negative_oil_is_economically_devastating/,648,"At the height of trading today, /CLK20 hit -$40.32. This means someone was willing to pay you $40,320 per contract to take 1000 barrels deliverd. Seems great and all, everyone gets paid, you store them in your garage or whatever, but there is an underlying issue here... storage.

Generally, retail paper traders are not trading this contract, most brokerages won’t even allow you to trade the front month after last week. You would be forced to trade the forward (June) /CLM20 or later. People trading today are actual physical buyers and sellers, large companies needing to move physical oil. For it to go negative means a lot of people were on the phones calling around trying to find space to store said oil, and they couldn’t find the space for that oil, which drove the price negative just so they could unload the contract. Who cares right? 

We should all care... why? [Government has extended DoD Travel Ban to June 30](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/defense-main/2020/04/dod-to-extend-stop-movement-order-through-june-30/) so you can be sure if they are banning non essential travel through June 30 they are likely going to ban people from coming into the work place (that cube life, the resurgence of COVID)... Travel by plane and commuting to work... the two biggest reasons for oil/gas... They have been on hold for about 1.5 months and now the government is stating that they will be on hold for another 2 months at least. Now lets not even talk about heating oil needed for the northern areas coming into spring… 

You cant keep pumping oil if you have no demand for it, and you have no place to store it, although the later is more important. If you pump it, where do you put it? As I said before, to go -$40 today it means people were calling everything they could think of (container ships, tanker trucks, strategic reserve, out of the way storage facilities, etc) before they absorb a $40K loss per contract (and they sell thousands).

What must happen next, which little demand is they must idle the pumps. They cant and wont pay oil workers $100K a year to sit around with an idle pump. We have about 10M oil workers in the US. We are potentially looking at 80% of those to be laid off… and this will take months to go through existing inventory if its completely full. This will extend for months, likely into Q4 2020, even Q1 2021. 

As a result of no travel and a slow opening all commerce will suffer. We are talking a stagnant society until at least June 30. More retail, consumer goods, automobile companies are going to go bankrupt. We have an annual GDP in excess of $20T. This is grinding to a halt. FED/Govt/Treasury has thrown ~$5T at it already, but they will need to throw $2T a month at it to keep it all afloat. Factor in treasuries, credit, bonds (corps), MBS, etc and we are looking at roughly $45T to service.  This is all becoming increasingly more difficult to service with a stalled economy. This is where we are now. 

This is why its likely unsustainable and we are about to really feel the pinch. The current market with S&P (/ES) trading at 2820 (was almost 2900 last week) is an artificial pump. How long will wall street look the other way while the government throws $1T here and there?",2020-04-21 10:33:39

Apparently, such events blow over in about 4 weeks; UAL is up 13% since",1395,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/6bddtd/a_month_ago_united_airlines_stock_dropped_by_5/,96,"Following this discussion:

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/64q201/united_airlines_stock_down_over_5_premarket/dg4e7cm/

The general consensus was: Always bet against the angry lynch mob. Their emotional rage dies out within a month, the fundamentals don't.

This was the highest rated comment by /u/rationalcomment

So I decided to look into it as this was not the first time I had heard about this phenomenon and it definitely goes against my natural instincts- apparently, companies with sound “fundamentals” always bounce back and often have incredible gains after about 4 weeks following an incident that sparks public outrage.

And this is how the UAL STOCK BEHAVED

On April 13/2017 UAL closed @ $69.07, with a farther dip to $67.75 after the CEO defended his employees with his “re-accommodating” comment  and everyone grabbed an extra pitch fork- this translated to a drop of about 5% from its April 10/2017 closing .

May 12 2017, or about 4 weeks after the incident, UAL closed at $76.41 which is almost a 13% gain since the dip.
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UAL?p=UAL

In summer 2009, UAL had an incident with a Canadian  musician and his guitar, and there was a dip and bounce in the following 4 weeks. The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4zOqozo) was released on July 6 2009. UAL opened at $3.31 on 6 July 2009, dipped to an intra-day low $3.07 (-7.25%) on 10 July 2009 but traded as high as $6.00 (+81.27%) four weeks later

Interestingly, this phenomenon checks out on both occasions  given the PR disasters-but how and why is this possible?

 Lets compare it to a similarly sized company in the industry such as Southwest LUV. 

NB. I use fleet size when evaluating an airline's size. There are other metrics such as passengers carried, destinations, assets etc but for an airline business, to quite one of my profs, “it only makes you money when the plane is in the air; when it’s on the ground, it is costing you money”-this is a very simple way of looking at the big picture but I can qualify it in more detail. UAL has 738 to LUV’s 727

Since April 10/2017 to May 12 2017 LUV has had a 6% gain while UAL has had  11% gain in the last 4 weeks.However, looking back to the beginning of the year, UAL has had modest gains of about 5% ($72.71-$76.41 YTD) while LUV has had about a 14.5%($49.98-$57.22YTD) gain in the same time period. 
If you are just looking at the last 4 weeks, UAL performance is quite impressive and this what the proponents of the phenomenon are reporting. Remember, they reported an 81.27% upside in 2009 after 4 weeks of that video being released?

Lets look at some historical trends beginning with just before that video was released in 2009
4 weeks before the video was released, UAL opened at $4.99 i.e. Jun 8 2009 while LUV opened at $6.91. Both saw a slide in their share price UAL-33.6% & LUV -6.3% i.e. $3.31, $6.47 respectively.

It would be interesting to see how the two compare if LUV had suffered a 33.6% loss i.e $6.91+33%=$4.58

Had both these companies suffered a 33% slide, LUV would be starting its recovery at $4.58 while UAL starts at $3.31/  The quote on wikipedia says UAL traded as high as $6.00 (+81.27%) four weeks later and presents this as evidence to this phenomenon. 

Now lets see what happens when we apply an 81.27% upside to LUV i,e, $4.58+81.27%=$8.30

On Aug 6 2009, LUV  actually had am intra day high of $9.19 and closed at $9.15 or 100.6% upside. This is how proponents of this phenomenon would have presented their material had this exact same incident had been with LUV. 

Without the fictitious event, LUV had a 42% upside in the period outlined

What proponents of this phenomenon conveniently fail to mention is that the stock had been trending downwards to this point for other unrelated reasons. But the video certainly didn’t help.  

Now, it is difficult to determine how much of 82% was part of a general recovery industry wide (AAL 19%, DEL 10%, LUV 42%), or a reaction to rumours of a merger? -United was in active negotiations with Continental at this point and a merger was signed in [May 2010.](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/03/business/03merger.html)

On close Friday, UAL was up 12.78% from its low of $67.75 during the bad press in early April. The week before this incident, UAL, on average, traded at about $70.60. Given this as the starting point and adding 11%, UAL,  would be closing at about $79.62. This lag is compounded when you consider there was a 10% dip previously due to another unforced error in 2009. 

And there is no way of determining how much more United had to pay for Continental shares given that this initial scandal happened so close to coming to an agreement g-this was an all-stock-deal worth about $3bn.

In their latest scandal, UAL  has had to revise their overbooking policy, which made airlines a lot of money and made it very generous to try and kill the bad press. Delta is now offering up to $10k for an overbooking error which is way above industry standards and govts are looking to introduce legislation on this practise. I'm not convinced  the company has realized all its losses from a 13% gain in 4 weeks but I maybe wrong. However,a big part of the airline business fundamentals, is customer service, and while I'm not part of the lynch mob, I'm not willing to bet against them.

tl;dr- [This quote on wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Breaks_Guitars#Stock_price_effect) on the stock price effect, is somewhat misleading as it suggests that losses following bad publicity are usually recovered within 4 weeks. The quote uses the UAL broken guitar incident in 2009 that purportedly had more than an 80% upside within 4 weeks. In fact, anyone who bought this stock a year prior, i.e mid August 2008,(UAL $10.22) to this event, was still down more than 40% in mid August 2009 (UAL $6.38) despite the surge. Bad press does affect the stock price negatively, and does remain depressed relatively beyond the purported 4 week threshold.

Cohn, President Trump’s top economic adviser, plans to resign, becoming the latest in a series of high-profile departures from the Trump administration, White House officials said on Tuesday.

The officials insisted there was no single factor behind the departure of Mr. Cohn, who heads the National Economic Council. But his decision to leave came after he seemed poised to lose an internal struggle amid a Wild West-style process over Mr. Trump’s plan to impose large tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

“Gary has been my chief economic adviser and did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again,” Mr. Trump said in a statement to The New York Times. “He is a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.”

Mr. Cohn is expected to leave in the coming weeks. He will join a string of recent departures by senior White House officials, including Mr. Trump’s communications director and a powerful staff secretary.

Yet the departure of Mr. Cohn, a free-trade oriented Democrat who fended off a number of nationalist-minded policies during his year in the Trump administration, could have a ripple effect on the president’s economic decisions and on the financial sector.

 [GME SI left to the rightmost column(exported from ORTEX data)](https://imgur.com/a/0gQjYT6)

We know GME absolutely ripped in Friday due to gamma hedging. Some old shorts covering could have been the main reason behind the ignition switch but I am not very confident about that.

GME is already ripping in pre-market and I don't know what's triggering that. Maybe it's retail euphoria.

Looks like we will continue to have gamma squeezes, tweets from Papa Cohen etc until shorts are forced to cover and close most of their shorts. I am changing my thesis. I thought we will see a slow TSLA-esque short-covering in GME. Looks like we are setting up for something much quicker.

)

> Uber failed to overturn a tribunal ruling that **it should treat its drivers as “workers”**. If forced to treat its 40,000 UK drivers as “workers”, **it'll have guarantee minimum wage and holiday pay**. Uber says this would probably mean it scheduled shifts rather than allowing them to “log on” when they wanted to. Uber may then **have to pay employers’ national insurance contributions (UK Social Security) and VAT (sales tax)**

> Uber is **able to appeal again** to the Court of Appeal and possibly to the Supreme Court. 

> Tom Elvidge, Uber UK’s acting general manager, said: “**Almost all taxi and private hire drivers have been self-employed for decades**, long before our app existed. The main reason why drivers use Uber is because they value the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive and so we intend to appeal.”

> Original tribunal found in October 2016 that the **company exerted too much control over their work to class them as truly independent.**

> James Farrar, **one of the two Uber drivers who brought the case**, said: “Uber cannot go on flouting UK law with impunity and depriving people of their minimum wage rights.”

> Deliveroo, a food delivery gig platform, is also facing a legal challenge from a group of couriers who say they are not truly self-employed. Ditto for Pimlico Plumbers, taxi firm Addison Lee and courier company CitySprint


The implications are enormous here as it means:

- no more ability to charge a surge or at least high a multiple since shifts scheduling means they can control some basic level of service
- no more ability to incent people with 'unlimited earnings potential'
- that slavish customer service to maintain 4 stars goes out the window when you can't just fire people
- realistically, if it comes to pass I expect not many drivers to pass the 'probationary' period when many/most benefits can be held back


FWIW, I think Uber's atrocious hubris is giving a bad face to what can potentially be a great industry. If they just weren't such dicks to everyone all the time (see: Lyft) something could be worked out",2017-11-11 00:26:04

So we have all these companies right now with their hands out. Unable to survive 2-3 really bad months. These are companies that've made sky high profits for years and years but have managed themselves in a paycheck to paycheck way regardless. 

We need to stop. We can't invest in companies that are completely fiscally irresponsible. Do not reward companies that can't stand 2-3 months of pressure without begging for a bailout. As far as I'm concerned they can go straight to hell for being so irresponsible.

Invest in strong, smart companies that have cash on hand, that can stand a few bad months, that haven't spent all their profits on share buybacks.

This bill, which President Trump quickly signed, was self-evidently bad for consumers at the time—and if anyone needs further proof of how ridiculous and harmful these clauses are, just look at what Wells Fargo has been up to over the past several months. The mega-bank famously issued at least 3.5 million fake accounts without consumer consent, triggering a $185 million fine to state and federal regulators. The bank aimed to demonstrate sales growth to investors and boost the stock price with bogus numbers, but millions of customers got caught up in the exchange, paying unnecessary fees and taking hits to their credit scores. Scores of defrauded customers sued Wells Fargo in a series of class-action lawsuits.

Wells Fargo then tried to defy metaphysical reality: It moved to block one class-action case in Utah by claiming that the arbitration clause in customer contracts on the real accounts they held at the bank also applied to the fake accounts. By this theory, Wells Fargo customers signed away their legal rights when it came to accounts they didn’t even sign.   https://www.thenation.com/article/the-ceo-of-wells-fargo-might-be-in-big-big-trouble/",2018-01-06 00:01:23

680,Bloomberg: Nikola’s History of Discrepancies Has Been Hiding in Plain Sight,1340,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/irhabh/bloomberg_nikolas_history_of_discrepancies_has/,310,"(Bloomberg) -- Nikola Corp. has left a trail of inconsistent statements and contradictory announcements that are now coming under scrutiny from short-sellers eager to poke holes in the electric-vehicle company’s success story.

Hindenburg Research, which holds a short position in Nikola stock and stands to gain if the shares fall, released a report Thursday detailing what it called “dozens of lies” about the company’s capabilities, partnerships or products. The firm used internal emails, analyzed photos and even cited an investigator dispatched to rural Utah to test how far a car would roll down a hill. Nikola said Hindenburg’s report was full of falsehoods but hasn’t offered anything specific to rebut the allegations.

It doesn’t take a hedge fund or a private eye to determine that Nikola, which struck a partnership this week with General Motors Co., has a pattern of discrepancies. A look at some of its announcements and filings, along with statements and tweets by Chairman Trevor Milton and other executives over the past few years, yields other examples that weren’t part of Hindenburg’s report. “It’s a bit confusing trying to follow Trevor on his various social media outlets about the timing and cadence of communication of the different variables that you’re talking about,” Jeff Osborne, a Cowen & Co. analyst, told executives on an Aug. 4 conference call.

Nikola’s shares have tumbled 24% since the Hindenburg report, which, among other sources, cited a Bloomberg story from June about the company exaggerating the capabilities of a truck.

“We are committed to doing our best to keep the investing public and all of our stakeholders informed and up to date at all times,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Russell said Friday in an emailed response to questions from Bloomberg about the following items.

Under Construction

At a press event on July 22, ahead of the groundbreaking of Nikola’s Coolidge, Arizona, factory, Head of Global Manufacturing Mark Duchesne fielded a question on when construction would get underway. “That one is an easy answer,” he said. “Start of construction is tomorrow.”

The timeline was repeated by Milton the following day in a tweet. But “construction” turns out to be a broad term.

To facilitate the groundbreaking ceremony, the city of Coolidge issued Nikola a temporary use permit on July 13. The document, obtained by Bloomberg, allowed the company to do some limited ground clearing and preparation for holding the event, along with listing a plan for coronavirus safeguards. It didn’t allow further construction to start beyond that. The company also obtained a Pinal County dust permit around the same time, a legal requirement in Arizona.

On Aug. 7, the company received its at-risk grading and drainage permit, City Manager Rick Miller said by phone. The permit allows Nikola to clear dirt and do drainage work on the site, but as yet the company doesn’t have the permits required for foundation work, plumbing, electrical or vertical construction, Miller said. The permits are available through public-records requests.

On Wednesday, Nikola said in a tweet that Coolidge’s city council had approved the company’s “factory masterplan” and that “construction can now go forward.” This is only partly true, Miller said. It was the planning and zoning commission that approved a “major site plan.” The approval will allow Nikola and its architects and engineers to apply for the next batch of permits.

In a statement, Nikola said that by “construction” it meant everything from groundbreaking to seeking permits. Now that its building plan is approved, “the various permits will be obtained in cadence with the steps of the construction. We remain on schedule for Phase 1,” the company said in an email.

”The factory will be up in 12 months,” Milton said in a live broadcast on Instagram on Friday night. “The permit was just issued by the city. We are all good to go.”

Puzzling Partnership

Nikola has a stated ambition of manufacturing hydrogen-powered fuel cell semi trucks by 2023. Since 2017, it has had an agreement for German auto parts supplier Robert Bosch Gmbh to “develop, build, test and support” various components for Nikola’s prototypes including a fuel-cell system, battery packs, steering pumps and motors, according to a regulatory filing in March.

The details of which partner is contributing what to the project has shifted over time, and the future of the deal has gotten hazier.

Nikola agreed to pay Bosch around $40 million for the development, according to the filing. In a presentation to investors in April, Nikola described the agreement with Bosch as a “co-development” and strategic supply chain partnership and said the company would jointly own any intellectual property developed with Bosch.

However, Nikola executives have regularly stated that Nikola designed, developed and will provide much of the technology for its vehicles -- not Bosch. On Friday, Chief Financial Officer Kim Brady said that Nikola will provide only 15% of the parts in battery electric pickups due to be built in Ulm, Germany, while partner Iveco provides the rest. However, he added that Nikola’s input represents 90% of the truck’s value.

“We are responsible for Nikola Tre -- the batteries, e-axle, e-motors, inverters, BMS system, infotainment system,” Brady said. “All the key electric propulsion systems come from Nikola.”

As recently as Aug. 25, Bosch has said that it’s “working with the company to make the fuel-cell drive for trucks suitable for mass production.”

On Monday, Nikola announced that GM -- not Bosch -- will mass-supply a fuel cell system for Nikola’s Class 7 and 8 semi trucks, as well as the battery packs for its debut electric pickup, the Badger. On Friday, Nikola clarified that Bosch will supply semi truck fuel cells in Europe, while GM will have exclusivity everywhere else.

“Bosch is an investor, board member and supplier to Nikola. They help us in many facets of our business as our partner,” Nikola said.

Milton bristled at a claim by a Twitter user that Nikola was jilting Bosch in favor of GM.

“Bosch as a company with a dedicated hydrogen strategy welcomes the decision of GM to enter this market as an important player,” Bosch spokesman Tim Wieland said in an email. “Beyond that, Nikola and Bosch have been working together for several years, not only on the fuel cell power train but also on other innovations like the steering system and the Mirror Cam System for the first prototypes of the Nikola trucks. The two companies will continue to cooperate in the future, also on fuel cells.”

Game Changer

Nikola’s narrative about its battery strategy has also shifted over time.

In November 2019, Nikola issued a press release claiming to have “game-changing” battery cell technology that it would unveil at an event in 2020. Nikola also said it had entered into a letter of intent to acquire a “world-class battery engineering team” to help bring the new battery to pre-production.

“We are talking about doubling the range of BEVs and hydrogen-electric vehicles around the world,” Milton said in the statement.

In July, Milton tweeted that Nikola would “make the entire pack like the top guys do” for its upcoming pickup truck, called the Badger. He said that all internal components, such as batteries, inverters, software and controls, are Nikola’s own intellectual property. “We own it all in house,” he said.

Milton clarified in a tweet on Thursday that Nikola’s change of direction -- to use GM’s Ultium battery technology for the Badger -- was a result of cost analysis and cost savings.

Beer Trucks

Back in March, Nikola said in a presentation to investors that it has a “signed binding agreement” to provide Anheuser-Busch with as many as 800 hydrogen fuel cell electric semi trucks. What the presentation didn’t say was that Anheuser-Busch committed to buy fewer trucks than that, and doesn’t have to buy any at all.

The deal was first announced in May 2018 and stated the trucks were originally expected to be integrated into Anheuser-Busch’s dedicated fleet by the end of 2020, according to a press release.

That timeline isn’t going to be met. During the Aug. 4 earnings call, Russell, the CEO, updated investors on the deal, saying, “We do believe that we’ll be able to give them test prototypes before the end of 2021; serial production or mass production of the fuel cell truck will not begin until 2023.”

That does corroborate with the timeline for production set out in a July filing -- and to be fair, lots of people’s plans have changed this year. But in the same filing, Nikola revealed that Anheuser-Busch retains the right to cancel the truck order, though there’s no indication that will happen. The contract also has lease terms and rental rates that may be hard for Nikola to meet, according to the filing, “depending on our ability to develop our trucks and hydrogen network according to current design parameters and cost estimates.”

The agreement between the two companies states that Anheuser-Busch gets priority of delivery for as much as 20% of Nikola’s initial “production line of Class 8 vehicles.” To get production going by 2023, Nikola must work to have dedicated equipment in Anheuser Busch’s breweries and distribution centers by the end of 2021, according to the deal terms. Anheuser-Busch only agreed to use at least 600 trucks -- the 800 figure, according to the document, is an estimate of what the brewer will need.

“They have been, and continue to be, a great long-term partner in our shared vision of a zero-emission future (a Nikola Two prototype hauled our first load over public roads for them in St. Louis not too long ago),” Russell said in the statement Friday, referring to Anheuser-Busch. “Our original agreement with them has been modified over time. The current agreement terms are as we set forth in our earnings call.”

Anheuser-Busch didn’t respond to a request for comment. The partnership with Nikola will help the brewer transition its entire long-haul fleet to zero-emission vehicles, Anheuser-Busch said last November.

Prototype Production

On July 13, Milton said European partner Iveco was already producing vehicle prototypes.

“We have a truck coming in to production right now with 720KwH, the largest battery we know of anywhere in the world coming in to production,” Milton said on the TC’s Charcast Podcast. “We have five of them coming off the assembly line right now in Ulm, Germany.”

On Aug. 4, during the company’s debut earnings call, Russell echoed the sentiment, saying that the first five prototypes were “coming off the end of the facility at this point.”

Those statements were a mischaracterization of Nikola and Iveco’s progress in Ulm, according to two people familiar with the matter. The assembly line is still under construction and not yet operational or building prototypes, the people said. There are prototypes being built by hand in a workshop, one of the people said.

“As stated previously, the first five production prototypes of the Nikola Tre are being completed, by an assembly team at the Ulm facility. Also as stated previously, the Nikola/IVECO JV mass production line facility in Ulm is still under construction, and is on track for the start of regular serial production in 2021,” Russell said Friday. “We anticipate that a number of current IVECO personnel will join the Nikola/IVECO JV production team in Ulm.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last week, which could heighten fears the COVID-19 pandemic was inflicting lasting damage to the labor market.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 898,000 for the week ended Oct 10, compared to 845,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 825,000 applications in the latest week.

The weak labor market and resulting economic hardship are major hurdles to President Donald Trump’s chances of getting a second term in the White House when Americans go to the polls on Nov. 3. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic Party’s candidate, has blamed the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus crisis for the worst economy in at least 73 years.

Seven months into the pandemic in the United States, claims remain well above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, though below a record 6.867 million in March. About 3.8 million people had permanently lost their jobs in September, with another 2.4 million unemployed for more than six months.

With the White House and Congress struggling to agree on another rescue package for businesses and the unemployed, claims are likely to remain elevated. Tens of thousands of airline workers have been furloughed. State and local government budgets have been crashed by the pandemic leading to layoffs that are expected to escalate without help from the federal government.

High unemployment and a resurgence in new coronavirus cases across the United States threaten the economy’s recovery from a recession, which started in February.

Though economic activity rebounded in the third quarter because of fiscal stimulus, the stubbornly high jobless claims suggest momentum ebbed heading into the fourth quarter.

Third-quarter GDP growth estimates are topping a 32% annualized rate. The economy contracted at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest decline since the government started keeping records in 1947. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter have been cut to as low as a 2.5% rate from above a 10% pace.",2020-10-16 00:12:00

Reducing short term volatility also kills expected returns in the long run.

* **The stoppage follows the Securities and Exchange Commission telling Hertz that the regulator has issues with the rental car company’s plan to sell stock.**  


Shares of [Hertz](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=HTZ) halted trading Wednesday pending news amid the bankrupt company’s controversial stock sale.

The stoppage follows the Securities and Exchange Commission telling [Hertz](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=HTZ) that the regulator [has issues](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/17/the-sec-told-bankrupt-hertz-it-has-issues-with-its-plan-to-sell-stock-chairman-jay-clayton-says.html) with the rental car company’s plan to sell stock.

“In this particular situation, we have let the company know that we have comments on their disclosure,” SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said on CNBC’s [“Squawk on the Street”](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-on-the-street/) on Wednesday. “In most cases when you let a company know that the SEC has comments on their disclosure they do not go forward until those comments are resolved.”

Shares were trading down about half a percent to $1.94.

Hertz filed for bankruptcy May 22, hurt as demand for car rentals dried up as travelers have stayed home during the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/). The stock hit a low of 40 cents intraday on May 26. But in the days ahead, shares began to recover and eventually surged to more than $6 per share last Monday.

Following the increase, Hertz asked the bankruptcy court Thursday to allow it to sell up to $1 billion in shares, a last ditch effort for it to raise capital even though the value of the stock could get wiped out. The request [was approved by the court Friday.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/hertz-granted-approval-to-sell-up-to-1-billion-in-shares.html)

Hertz said in a government filing Monday that it would sell up to $500 million in common stock. It warned potential investors that it’s [almost certain that the equity will become worthless.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/15/hertz-says-it-expects-stockholders-to-lose-all-their-money-in-filing-for-selling-more-stock.html)

Such a sale is highly unusual for a company going through Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings since common shareholders, who are last in line when assets are allocated during court proceedings, may be left with worthless stock.

The court, in its ruling, said the approval “in no event will result in the issuance” of the shares. The debtors are authorized, but not required, to sell shares of the common stock.

The stock also could be delisted. Hertz in a public filing with the [SEC last week said](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3581821-hertz-to-challenge-nyse-delisting) that it has appealed a delisting request by the NYSE.

700,Company Debt Analysis - I created a checklist to help investors understand things to look for when analyzing a company's financial health - particularly in regards to the amount of debt they have and if they can afford to pay it.,1305,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hyib83/company_debt_analysis_i_created_a_checklist_to/,106,"If companies cannot afford to pay their debt then eventually they will go bankrupt and you, the shareholder, will be left with NOTHING! How much debt a company has and more importantly if they are able to pay back their debt is essential to know before investing in the company. Ultimately companies who become too over-leveraged with debt may face trouble repaying it if their revenue declines, their earnings drop, if interest rates rise or in the case of COVID-19, an unexpected black swan event comes out of nowhere. Below is the checklist I use when analyzing the debt of a company.

Debt Analysis Checklist:

Step 1: Calculate Total Debt   
\- Remember use only ""Term Debt"" both short term and long term   
\- Liabilities are NOT Debt  
\- Ideally total debt would be decreasing over time, however, more important than the total dollar amount is whether or not the company can pay it

Step 2: Calculate Debt to Equity  
\- Debt / Equity = Long Term debt / Shareholder equity   
\- I do not include Short Term debt in the above equation unless the company does not have enough cash/cash equivalents and short term investments to cover it  
\- Ideally companies would have 25% or less debt

Step 3: Does the company have positive free cash-flow?   
\- We want to see positive free cash flow. This means the company is actually bringing in ""cash"" which it could use to pay back debt  
\- If a company has negative free cash flow then it's not bringing in any money!!! How can they pay their debt obligations with no money?

Step 4: Does the company have enough cash/cash equivalents/short term investments to cover short term debt?  
\- We want to see companies have enough cash/equivalents and short-term investments on their balance sheet to cover short term debt

Step 4: Does the company have enough free cash flow to cover short term debt?  
\- If the company is free cash flow positive, does that amount meet or exceed its short term debt obligations. Ideally it would.

Step 5: Check the income statement to see how much the company's interest expense is.  
\- Does interest / dividend income cover interest expense? This would be ideal!  
\- Does operating income / EBIT cover interest expense? If so what is the TIE ratio (times-interest-earned ratio: EBIT / Interest Expense). The higher the number the better!

Step 6: Look for trends in net income and free cash flow  
\- We want to invest in companies that make money and have positive free cash flow. If these numbers begin to go negative then investigate and determine if the company can turn things around.

Step 7: Calculate the company's overall cash position  
\- Overall cash position = cash + equivalents + short term investments / Long-Term Debt  
\- Higher the number the better.

Step 8: Remember not all debt is bad. What is more important that the total amount of debt is whether the company has the operating income, interest/dividend income, or free cash flow to cover it. Even if they took a significant hit to revenue - would the company still be able to pay its debt obligations - those are the types of companies we want to invest in!",2020-07-27 11:41:48
701,Bloomberg: Nikola founder Milton's fall reveals what his backers feared,1306,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/j1biar/bloomberg_nikola_founder_miltons_fall_reveals/,284,"Back in March, long before a short seller would raise questions about electric-truck company Nikola Corp. and hasten its founder’s exit, **early investors in the company were expressing concerns of their own. Those investors, led by mutual-fund giant Fidelity Investments, were worried that Trevor Milton, for all his brash visionary talk and Twitter braggadocio, lacked the ability that Elon Musk possesses to deliver these sorts of newfangled products to market. They lobbied successfully to remove him as CEO before the company’s June IPO and for Milton’s father to leave the board, according to people familiar with the matter. When the deal was done, Milton only held the title of chairman, the post he resigned this month.**

The back-room negotiations show that Milton’s past was a concern to investors months before General Motors Co. executives placed a bet on the company in a US$2 billion deal carved out after the IPO. They liked Milton’s vision and his ability to raise cash and felt the venture was safeguarded from his shortcomings in operations by his push upstairs, say people familiar with the matter. Nonetheless, the events that have unfolded since the short-seller report, with Nikola’s stock plunging amid a steady stream of negative headlines, have exposed just how high the risks still were.

Now, it’s up to former GM Vice Chairman Steve Girsky, whose blank-check company VectoIQ took Nikola public via reverse merger in June, and Nikola CEO Mark Russell to stabilize the business and regain investor confidence. The plan with GM was to use Nikola’s hot stock and Milton’s ability to raise money to build a hydrogen-fueled trucking business with GM’s technology.

“There is obviously someone on the diligence side who isn’t going to get a nice bonus this year,” said Reilly Brennan, founder of the venture capital fund Trucks Inc. “The best possible thing if you’re a shareholder is that Milton is no longer running the company and you have Girsky as chairman and GM providing technology.”

The GM deal was originally scheduled to close Sept. 30, and the automaker has said it plans to carry through, but that timing may slip, say people familiar with the matter. BP Plc is still engaged with Nikola in talks to partner on a network of hydrogen fueling stations for fuel-cell trucks the company hopes to sell, but also is slowing the pace for a deal, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. BP and GM declined to comment.

Milton’s tale reads like a Greek tragedy. The report by short seller Hindenburg Research accused Milton of overhyping Nikola’s technology and has prompted investigations by the Justice Department and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A cousin has accused him of a decades-ago sexual assault, which he denies. The company’s value peaked at US$30 billion and is now worth about US$7 billion.

Girsky and GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra have both said publicly that they did plenty of due diligence. People familiar with the matter say that GM found out when scouting the deal that it had better batteries and fuel-cell technology but joined forces because Nikola had a working semi truck and access to capital markets. In addition, GM will get paid to build Nikola’s Badger pickup on existing assembly lines. Milton was so excited to get the Badger pickup program moving that he signed a deal that heavily favored GM, one of the people said.

Nikola’s stock and GM’s US$2 billion stake are worth less than half what they were on Sept. 8, when the deal was announced. Milton’s own stake is worth US$1.7 billion, down from almost US$5 billion at one point.

Milton said in a June interview with Bloomberg News that he grew up in modest surroundings in Layton, Utah. His family moved to Las Vegas when he was very young and he lost his mother to cancer shortly after moving back to Utah in the sixth grade. He wrote on Twitter he didn’t finish high school, earning an equivalency certification instead, and later dropped out of college. His Twitter account has since been deleted.

He grew up in a tight-knit Mormon family, according to Aubrey Smith, his first cousin. She went on social media recently and accused him of sexually assaulting her in 1999 when she was 15 and he was 17.

In a public account on Facebook and Twitter, and repeated in a phone interview, Smith said that Milton came onto her at the funeral of their grandfather. He took her shirt off without permission, Smith wrote, and then he touched her inappropriately before someone knocked at the door and she ran out.

Milton denied the allegations through a spokesman.

Smith said Milton raised money from family members to get his start. He founded and ran several businesses, including a home-security company that Milton claims he sold for US$1.5 million. Next, in 2009, he founded an e-commerce platform called Upillar.com, which Milton claims “pioneered the shopping cart online.”

Then he got into clean propulsion but ended up embroiled in litigation with dHybrid Inc., which he founded in 2009. The company retrofitted diesel vehicles with natural-gas-burning turbines, claiming the dual system had greater efficiency.

But a deal with Swift Transportation Co. in 2010 ended in court when Swift alleged dHybrid defaulted on a US$322,000 loan and that it retrofitted only half of the agreed vehicles. The case was dismissed in 2015.

Milton later tried to sell dHybrid to a company called sPower in May 2012 but that, too, got mired in lawsuits after sPower backed out and accused Milton of exaggerating its technological capabilities.

Amid the litigation, Milton started another company with a very similar name, dHybrid Systems, selling it in 2014 to Worthington Industries.

During an interview with Bloomberg in June, Milton said that dHybrid Inc. was a success but conceded that, “we ended up closing that one down because of some litigation.”

His next startup was Nikola, founding it in 2014 in Salt Lake City before moving to Phoenix. Emulating Musk, he took the name from the electricity pioneer Nikola Tesla, and the company was soon billed as the Tesla of Trucks. His plan was seen as potentially disrupting the entire transportation industry by making trucks that ran on batteries or hydrogen-fuel cells. He also planned to build a network of hydrogen filling stations.

Friends and Family

Milton had friends and family members working for Nikola despite resumes that didn’t match the job. His brother, Travis Milton, is director of hydrogen and infrastructure. His LinkedIn profile shows that most of his experience was being “self-employed” in Maui. The short seller, Hindenburg Research, said that Travis Milton poured concrete as a contractor. Milton’s father Bill was originally on the board but stepped down when VectoIQ took the company public.

The company’s stock prospectus said that Nikola had awarded more than 3 million stock options “to recognize the superior performance and contribution of specific employees.” The list included Travis Milton and an uncle, Lance Milton, the document said, acknowledging that they are relatives.

As Milton went public with Nikola’s technology, questions soon arose involving his claims about the company’s fuel-cell system. He bragged in an investor video in 2019 that the company had created “what other manufacturers said was impossible to design.” But while Nikola holds patents in fuel-cell and battery technology, most of its planned hardware was coming from German supplier Robert Bosch Gmbh.

Nikola Demonstrations

It became clear that Milton had gotten ahead of himself. A 2016 demonstration showed a truck that didn’t have a working hydrogen-fuel-cell system and was missing key parts, people familiar with the matter said in June. Milton said at the time that the parts were removed as a safety precaution.

In July of this year, he recorded a video of the semi truck in which he ran alongside the vehicle as it coasted at low speeds in a parking lot. Aping Musk’s combative social-media persona, Milton took a shot at his detractors saying, “these damned trolls, I wonder if they are going to apologize to everyone for the lies they spread the tens of thousands of comments about how fake we are.”

Girsky said in the webcast “Autoline This Week,” in which Bloomberg participated, that he has been in Nikola’s fuel-cell trucks and that they work.

Still, when the GM deal was done, GM will be supplying all of the technology for every global market except Europe. Nikola’s pickup truck, called Badger, will use GM’s Ultium battery, and the semis will run on a fuel cell developed by GM and Honda Motor Co.

Since Milton’s departure, Nikola has billed itself more as an integrator of other technologies into its Badger pickup and semi trucks.

For GM’s part, the automaker is protected from any financial downside. GM got 11 per cent of the stock for no cash investment and gets paid for its technology. If Nikola fails, GM won’t lose a dime.

Milton has remained silent and is out of the company. He unknowingly presaged his own downfall in the June interview with Bloomberg: “Part of becoming a better person in life is losing everything you have got and having nothing left.”

707,A discussion about “time in the market vs timing the market”,1288,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/k7cnl9/a_discussion_about_time_in_the_market_vs_timing/,354,"We’ve all seen it parroted on every investing related thread in the history of Reddit- “time in the market beats timing the market”. But I feel like this phrase gets misused quite a lot, and I would like to take this boring workday of a Saturday to just show the power of what “time in the market” actually has. 

1. What “time in the market” means and what it doesn’t mean 

Time in the market means, basically, maintaining ownership of assets that either 1, typically appreciate in value over time (stocks, real estate, commodities, etc) or 2, that produce a steady, ideally increasing, stream of income (dividend paying stocks, a business, rental properties, debt, etc). By “time in the market” it means that ownership of these assets over long periods of time, as in years and decades, is the key to wealth accumulation. If you look at most wealthy person alive today and in history, they gained their wealth through assets. They accumulate assets and own them. 

“Time in the market” does NOT mean buying clearly overvalued hype stocks because “I’m in for the long term”. I’m not gonna say any because I don’t want the comments to just be arguing about whether or not tesla is overvalued, but I hope you get the idea. However this doesn’t mean to just let your cash sit on the sidelines “waiting for a crash”. Typically there is no reason to have all your net worth tied up in cash, as it is the only asset class guaranteed to lose value over time. 

Rather, you should be in the middle: continuing to own assets you already own and being on the lookout for more, fairly valued ones. I promise you that you can find value out there if you look for it. Even then you don’t necessarily always have to be buying. Sometimes doing nothing is the best choice. 

2. You’re probably wasting your time (and money) 

If you’re anticipating a crash, good luck. There have been 8 major crashes since the 1920’s: an average of one every 12 years. There have been flash crashes and small recession but these shouldn’t concern you at all. On the large scale, the market has trended up for most of its existence. What makes this time different, exactly? Bulls have a tendency to believe that this time is different, but bears can have the same mindset, especially  considering that the US has been in a bull market for most of its history. So what makes this time different? 

Sure, we will enter a bear market eventually but the US market has never failed retest its highs. If you’re selling because you anticipate a “correction”, you’re just wasting your time and money. Corrections are a blip on the radar over time. They are normal, healthy and should be seen as a good thing, just the market breathing, per se; nobody actually thinks “stocks only go up and never go down”. 

Once you gain real money, in the high six figures and up, taxes will really start to eat into you. Selling positions with the intent to buy back in after a correction is probably an unprofitable endeavor. Why pay a good chunk of your earnings in taxes just to buy back 10% cheaper, especially when the 10% drop may or may not happen when you expect it to? This ties in to the last paragraph of point one, sometimes it’s best to do nothing and just continue to hold, letting your money work for you. 

3. Generational wealth

This is my main point. The Rothschilds, for example, have been building an empire for almost 300 years. That is 300 years of compounding interest. One thing they have done is accumulate assets, not sell them. The wealthy families of the Netherlands have been passing down assets for almost 400 years. 

Even on a less grandiose scale, just look to this subreddit. You’ll notice a lot of the users with higher portfolio balances probably received a nice inheritance somewhere along the way. This isn’t a bad thing and shouldn’t be shamed. After all, isn’t that everyone’s goal, to pass their wealth into their children? Unfortunately, with inheritances, a huge majority of inherited wealth is lost by the third generation. When the younger generation doesn’t know how to properly manage wealth, they end up wasting it all instead of further building it up. 

4. Compound interest 

Some call it the eighth wonder of the world, and rightfully so. There is no reason to interrupt compound interest unnecessarily. I would hope that most people here are investing with the goal of attaining compound interest, and selling your compounding assets is a solid way to halt it. 

5. Dividends 

Whether or not you chase dividends, I think we can all agree that we get some form of dividends or income from our investments. Dividends really show their power after several years of ownership. Buffett, for example, gets a 40% annual return from dividends on his initial Coca Cola investment. Fourty percent! And he doesn’t even DRIP them. Why on earth would people get rid of their assets that have potential to give those kind of returns after some years of ownership is beyond me. If you do a dividend return calculator going back multiple decades, you’ll find that most dividend paying securities will have similar returns once you have mature ownership of them. 

6. On “timing the market”

This is probably a controversial one but I definitely don’t believe in just buying whatever tickers you want because “time in the market beats timing the market”. Like I said above, time in > timing because of generational wealth, compound interest and ownership. It doesn’t mean buying the hottest Reddit ticker because you’re in for the long term. Taking well assessed risks with positive and realistic upside is ideal. 

Spending time to make sure the investment you’re about to make is a good investment is smart. If spending a week or two assessing your decision is a way to “miss out on sick gains bro, it’ll go up another 50% before you buy”, it’s probably a FOMO stock and you shouldn’t be in in the first place. If patience is key, that means patience with buying is just as important as patience with holding. 

At the end of the day I’m a believer in ownership. Looking through most of wealthy individuals of today and in history, they all had one thing in common: they maintained possession of assets. They don’t sell their portfolios because they’re scared of a crash, they don’t have their net worth in a savings account. They assume a little bit of managed risk and let their money work for them. 

I made this post because I have to work on a Saturday and have nothing going on, I hope you at least enjoyed it or disagree with it so we can have some discussion going.",2020-12-06 05:23:08

Edit: Article 

When it comes to companies exposed to emerging markets -- most notably China -- investors should beware the lack of visibility into their books, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton said Tuesday.

Foreign jurisdictions aren’t maintaining adequate standards of investor protection, and the U.S. has little control over that, Clayton and other officials said in a strongly worded statement. The group also underlined a longstanding point of conflict: that the main U.S. accounting watchdog can’t inspect the work that Chinese auditors do for companies that sell stock in American markets.

“In many emerging markets, including China, there is substantially greater risk that disclosures will be incomplete or misleading” and substantially less access to recourse in the event of investor harm, said the statement from four SEC officials and William Duhnke, chairman of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.


The issue over inspections of Chinese accounting firms dates back more than a decade and has always been a point of tension between the two countries. While U.S. regulators can access work papers underlying audits in most countries, China’s prohibition hampers their ability to conduct investigations and inspections designed to catch mistakes or malfeasance by auditors.

In December 2018, Clayton and Duhnke issued a joint statement saying that U.S. regulators “currently face significant challenges” in overseeing the financial reporting for listed companies based in China. They said that among auditors of 224 companies with total market capitalization of $1.8 trillion that posed obstacles for U.S. inspectors, 213 were in China or Hong Kong.

Tensions with China have been rising as Republicans, under pressure as critics assail President Donald Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, accuse the Asian nation of failing to give sufficient warning about the pandemic and offering misleading information about its severity.

Though the auditing issue hasn’t always been on the front burner, companies like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc. have raised billions of dollars in the U.S. while avoiding regulatory scrutiny. Nasdaq earlier this month halted trading in Luckin Coffee Inc., a Chinese chain enmeshed in an accounting scandal, and said the shares will remain frozen until the company satisfies requests for information.

In their Tuesday statement, the U.S. regulators said investors should especially consider the potential effects of the PCAOB’s blind spot in China.

“Even when the auditor signing the audit report is not based in China, if the company has operations in China, investors should consider whether significant portions of the audit may have been performed by firms in China,” the group said.


The PCAOB keeps a list of companies whose auditors it can’t inspect on its website.",2020-04-22 22:02:03

Sorry for the poor phrasing. So I will ask here, in ADDITION to all of the companies I’m high on listed below, I would like your opinions on PLTR. If you don’t have one, that’s cool too. Not trying to mislead anyone like I was accused of.

I like Lithium America (LAC), iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN), and Novus (NOVS) which will soon become AppHarvest, possibly the future of North American agriculture. 

I’ve been doing my research lately and just bought 100 shares of each. Not the biggest investment in the world but not small by any means. I’m big on anything renewable and have no problem playing the long-term game. I actually prefer it. 

How do you all feel about these? 

Also, additional opinions I would love from any of you would be your thoughts on Sunrun (RUN), Canadian Solar (CSIQ), and First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF (FAN). I am very high on all of these over the next 5 years. 

Thanks in advance, and I’m still learning along with everyone else. Warren Buffett said, invest in what you know, and it’s better to get a good company at an okay price, than an okay company at a good price. I’m less concerned about the week to week or month to month, and more so confident in renewable energy taking over during the next decade. It’s not a matter of opinion, and it’s not if, but when!

KEY POINTS

- Ninety-five percent of spot bitcoin trading volume is faked by unregulated exchanges, according to a study from Bitwise this week.

- The firm analyzed the top 81 crypto exchanges by volume on industry site CoinMarketCap.com. They report an aggregated $6 billion in average daily bitcoin volume. The study finds that only $273 million of that is legitimate. 

- ""People looked at cryptocurrency and said this market is a mess; that's because they were looking at data that was manipulated,"" says Matthew Hougan, global head of research at Bitwise. ""When you cut away the echo chamber of these nonsense numbers, it should be an efficient, well-arbitraged market.""

- The analysis showed that ""substantially all of the volume"" reported on 71 out of the 81 exchanges was wash trading, a term that describes a person simultaneously selling and buying the same stock, or bitcoin in this case, to create the appearance of activity in the market. In other words, it's not real.",2019-12-31 01:05:14

Fiscal stimulus is anything but certain by tomorrow, FED is doing unlimited QE, and Trump thinks the US can open up by Easter.

Fiscal stimulus takes time to kick in and for many people and businesses comes a week too late. It helps putting money in the pockets but doesn't suddenly restart the economic apparatus -only consumer and investment confidence do that.

Unlimited QE is like fishing with dynamite: quick results but a lot of underlying damage. lts worth noting that this is not a financial crisis but a public health crisis with financial implications. The FED can at best alleviate some symptoms but that's it.

The US is not testing nearly as fast as Korea (17 times less tests per capita when I checked this weekend), nor is it taking the lockdown serious. Unless a million tests appear by this weekend so the virus can be traced and narrowed down, Trump has to face the reality that he either locks down fully now or blows this crisis out of imaginable proportions in less than a month by opening.

So in my opinion, how does a bottom look like? 20-30% drop from the current level, with decreasing volatility starting in one or two weeks when the spread of the virus becomes more clear and the economic data hits us hard. Shy but ever more common gains and then more big rallies than drops (but not 10% if that's what you want).

We've only had one VIX spike, in 2008 there were 3. Also plenty of examples of fake rallies like today's and the first Friday of the month. The sp500 was grossly overpriced in February, so whatever it fell until the first days of March was barely an overdue correction. Now you have to input recession to get the true dimension of the collapse.

Disclaimer: this is just my opinion and I'm not offering investment advice

Edit: just to clarify I don't expect vix under 20 this year. When I say low I mean 30s perhaps 40s. I also know markets recover before clear good news begin. When I say let the economic data hit us I'm talking of at least having an actual dimension of the problem, so March and April readings.",2020-03-25 09:45:02

&#x200B;

 

U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren is drafting a bill that would call on  regulators to retroactively review about two decades of “mega mergers”  and ban such deals going forward.

Warren’s  staff recently circulated a proposal for sweeping anti-monopoly  legislation, which would deliver on a presidential campaign promise to  check the power of Big Tech and other industries. Although the Trump  administration is currently exploring their own antitrust probes, the  proposal is likely to face resistance from lawmakers.

 

According to a draft of the bill reviewed by Bloomberg, the proposal  would expand antitrust law beyond the so-called consumer welfare  standard, an approach that has driven antitrust policy since the 1970s.  Under the current framework, the federal government evaluates mergers  primarily based on potential harm to consumers through higher prices or  decreased quality. The new bill would direct the government to also  consider the impact on entrepreneurs, innovation, privacy and workers.

Warren’s bill, tentatively titled the Anti-Monopoly and  Competition Restoration Act, would also ban non-compete and no-poaching  agreements for workers and protect the rights of gig economy workers,  such as drivers for [Uber Technologies Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/UBER:US), to organize.

A draft of Warren’s bill was included in an email Monday from  Spencer Waller, the director of the Institute for Consumer Antitrust  Studies at Loyola University Chicago. Waller urged fellow academics to  sign a petition supporting it. He said Warren was working on the bill  with Representative David Cicilline, the most prominent voice on  antitrust issues in the House. Waller declined to comment on the email.

Representatives for Cicilline and Warren declined to comment. The existence of the bill and Warren’s support of it were [reported earlier](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/129fbf) this week by the technology publication the Information.

In  Washington, there is some support across the political spectrum for  increased antitrust scrutiny of large technology companies. Warren  positioned herself as a leader on the issue this year while campaigning  on a plan to break up Big Tech. She has repeatedly called for unwinding [Facebook Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US)’s acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, along with Google’s purchase of YouTube and advertising platform DoubleClick.

  

It’s not clear when a bill would be introduced or whether it  would move forward in its current form. Cicilline has said he would not  introduce antitrust legislation until he concludes an antitrust  investigation for the House Judiciary Committee in early 2020.

 

Amy Klobuchar, a Senator from Minnesota who’s also vying for the  Democratic nomination, has pushed legislation covering similar ground.  Klobuchar plans to introduce additional antitrust legislation soon,  according to a person familiar with the matter who wasn’t authorized to  discuss the plans and asked not to be identified.

Any proposal would face significant hurdles to becoming law,  and Warren’s version could be particularly problematic because it  promotes the idea that antitrust enforcement is equivalent to being  against big business, said Barak Orbach, a law professor at the  University of Arizona who received a draft of the bill. “The way I read  it is that Elizabeth Warren is trying to make a political statement in  the course of her campaign,” Orbach said. “It’s likely to have negative  effects on antitrust enforcement, so I just don’t see the upside other  than for the campaign.”

The bill proposes a ban on mergers where one company has annual revenue of more $40 billion, or where both companies have sales exceeding $15 billion,  except under certain exceptions, such as when a company is in immediate  danger of insolvency. That would seemingly put a freeze on many  acquisitions for [Apple Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US), [Alphabet Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GOOGL:US), Facebook, [Microsoft Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MSFT:US) and dozens of other companies. The bill would also place new limitations on smaller mergers.

Chris  Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University, said the  proposal would serve as an effective check on corporate power. “I don’t  think you’ll have new antitrust policy until Congress says the courts  have incorrectly interpreted the statutes,” he said. “Someone has to do  what Elizabeth Warren is doing.”",2019-12-05 22:35:47

“While this will be the largest single-day addition since 2004, it implies a mere net injection of RMB150bn as commercial banks are scheduled to repay RMB1.05tn of funds on Monday,” strategists at Singapore’s DBS Group Research wrote in a note. “The authority may need to inject more cash in the rest of the week via reverse repo and/or medium-term lending facility to soothe market nerves.”

Below is the quoted message from TD Ameritrade/Scottrade. They stay as nonpartisan as possible, given the spectrum of their clientele, so we should all probably take heed when they are taking a stand on a specific piece of legislation:

""Dear Valued Client, 

TD Ameritrade believes it's important to stand on the side of our clients. We have reviewed the Senate Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was released last week. Section 13533 of the Senate Bill imposes a single cost basis methodology for investors, ""first in, first out"" (""FIFO""), on all sales of securities (except mutual funds). 

For the average investor, this means possibly being required to pay the highest capital gains taxes where a stock has appreciated over time. 

On behalf of our approximately 11 million client accounts, we strongly oppose this provision. We believe it will harm individual investors by eliminating their freedom to decide when to take losses or gains on their investments, potentially resulting in an increased tax burden. 

An Example 

Suppose you hold a significant amount of a company's stock, accumulated over a 20-year career. You're now retired, and you want to sell some company stock to diversify your portfolio. Assume the purchases over time range from $5 per share up to $90 per share, but the stock now is trading at $50. 

If you sell at $50, rather than being able to take losses on the stock purchased above $50, the Senate Bill could require you to pay capital gains taxes on the appreciation of the stock from $5 to $50. That is, even if you have experienced sizeable paper losses on the purchases above $50, the Senate Bill might force you to pay taxes calculated on the largest gains possible. 

We don't think that's fair. We feel the Senate should stand up on behalf of individual investors and reject imposing a FIFO cost basis requirement on sales of securities.

Bed Bath & Beyond said Wednesday its sales tumbled nearly 50% during its latest quarter, even as online sales surged more than 100% during April and May with consumers stocking up on cleaning supplies and home decor. 

The company said it plans to permanently close roughly 200 of its namesake stores over the next two years, starting later in 2020, as it works toward getting back to profitability against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic. As of May 30, it operated a total of 1,478 stores, including 955 Bed Bath & Beyond shops. 

Bed Bath — which also owns the chains buybuy Baby, Christmas Tree Shops and Harmon Face Values — said these actions should generate annual cost savings of between $250 million and $350 million, excluding related one-time costs.",2020-07-09 07:34:15

737,White House latest budget projections call for a 2019 Federal budget deficit over $1 trillion.,1247,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/901dyr/white_house_latest_budget_projections_call_for_a/,615,"Economic growth is not turning out to be as robust as originally estimated so 2019 appears to be primed for [a massive federal budget shortfall](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/397445-white-house-budget-projects-1-trillion-deficit-in-2019). This is concerning for several reasons.... 1) We are currently in an economic expansion. This is the time for fiscal restraint to have a rainy day fund set aside for future recessions. 2) The current 2019 projections could get revised much lower if the economy slows down at all in the next couple of quarters. 3) Some cures for budget shortfalls are either to cut spending or increase taxes... both of which are going to be a headwind for future economic growth. 

If one estimates equity returns of 7-9% for the next 10-20 years, I would imagine this news would dampen that enthusiasm. Maybe 5-7% is more likely with a real return of 2-3%. Unfortunately fixed income and real estate both appear to be priced dearly at the moment so where does one look for decent inflation adjusted returns over the next 10-20 years? Diversification across all asset classes including lots of international appears to be prudent at the moment IMHO. 

Edit - Apparently people are somewhat confused about the difference between that US national debt and the federal deficit. The national debt is the total debt owed by the federal government (I believe it is around $20 trillion). The annual deficit, is the amount we are adding to the national debt each year (tax revenue minus federal spending). Starting in 2009-2010 the deficit was gradually declining each year until this year. It appears to be back on an increasing trajectory. ",2018-07-19 12:23:02

I think one of the delusions people are having lately is that they look at what people projected for AMZN 5-10-15 years ago and compare that to what actually happened.

While it is true that AMZN exceeded any sort of expectation by a huge margin (and did this consistently, year over year) it feels to me that we are taking perhaps one of the most unique success stories ever and then extrapolate that to others, thinking that as if those sort of growth and expectations are in fact more common and easy to achieve than not, regardless of the industry the subject company is operating in.

I could discuss this for a number of stocks, I wanted to open discussion for TSLA. As we all know, TSLA stock went up almost 8 fold in the last year. Today, it is common occurrence in the market that analysts are justifying these price levels and state why TSLA is just more than a car company. This argument obviously has its own merits, but aren't we little ahead ourselves and already attribute *from today,* all those things that could potentially be achieved and bake it into the price?

If we went back in in time, we could probably say AMZN was more than just a book company, but could we really say that they would have almost monopolistic power in most of the areas they operated in? Could we really say back in 2008 that AMZN would emerge the market leader in something like for instance Cloud? Or, did these things happen and then we realized how great AMZN became, *after the fact.* It feels like this was much easier to do in hindsight. But what if AMZN is truly that one outlier, anomaly, in the history of stock markets in terms of sustained growth and market power?

Isn't this what we are trying to do with TSLA here? I do think Elon is one of the greatest minds of our time and can achieve far beyond any other has achieved so I am not comparing Bezos or any other with Elon here. But what I am trying to say is that, just thinking TSLA as a company, aren't we already saying today that they already have monopolistic power in EV cars, autonomous driving, solar-energy trade, underground tunnels, robotaxis, etc. - you name it, as if they are already there and waiting to be switched on? It's as if we have already attributed everything we could imagine could happen and already announced TSLA as the winner.

Now this is the theory side of things. **How about financial side of things?**

I don't want to approach this from a car sales point of view, but I will make certain comments.

But what if we applied AMZN's growth trajectory into TSLA, without focusing too much on car sales, and just see what growth and valuation that would lead us? If TSLA is just more than a car company, what other example could serve best in terms of growth, thinking from an array of products and technological advantage perspective?

So I did a quick and dirty DCF calculation. In there, my starting point is the first year when AMZN hit $24 billion in revenue, which is 2009. TSLA achieved it's $24 billion in 2019, so from there onwards I am applying AMZN's growth trajectory for the following 10-11 years. Then, growth is gradually reduced in going into the terminal year. What this means is TSLA will be roughly $900 billion revenue generating company by year 20 (2040). From a car sales perspective, I can't really project how many cars it could sell in 20 years, but lets say it is 10 million cars. (I think GS said 15 million). Toyota in 2019 sold around this number I believe so with all the competition that will happen in this space, I think this is by no means and under-estimation. In 2019, TSLA sold roughly 367,500 cars and for a total revenue of $19.2 billion (excluding regulatory credits). On average this equates to $52k per car. In 20 years, car prices will be higher than what they are today obviously, but there will be competition and economies of scale to bring the price down. This one is hard to assume but let's say it grows 1.0% - 1.5% per year with long term inflation, again not necessarily higher because of these offsetting factors. If they do indeed sell 10+ million cars, this is roughly $600-650 billion from cars.

This leaves you with another $200-250 billion or so for other things, whatever you want to attribute this for - AI, robotaxies, insurance, and so on. Now this figure is a future value, so from today's perspective (using a discount rate of 8% used in my DCF below) that's roughly $60 billion (revenue). This is again a huge number, as it is almost another Facebook, 2x Coca-Cola etc., or half of GM/Toyota type business from revenue generating capability, again, from *today's perspective - none of which has already happened.*

Once again I want to point out that my revenue projections are not driven by bottoms-up car sales, rather, I am using simply AMZN trajectory in terms of growth, then try to attribute the resulting final revenue figure into parts, obviously majority being from car sales, and the rest from whatever you can think of. (Simply because we don't know what AI/Robos/Insurance/Transportation businesses can generate from revenue/profitability/market share perspective and more importantly what the competition in those areas can be). If you think TSLA can grow even more than AMZN, then I just want to remind you that you won't easily justify 40-50% revenue growth rates once you're in the 50+ billion zone, which is the point of the argument. AMZN, still achieved those growth rates when it had 100+ or 200+ billion, which is what we are already assuming here.

So in the stock price we have baked in, from a revenue perspective, a car business that will sell at least 10+ million cars (this number can obviously be higher but even 10 million will be big market share),  and other businesses that are worth, today, more than most companies you can think of.

Now this is the growth side of things. How about margins?

We know TSLA generated a last twelve months EBITDA margin of 14% as of Q3 2020. While margins from car manufacturing is certainly improving, most of this margin is actually attributed to sales of regulatory credits, which are by definition almost 100% profit. And so in reality, the margins are much lower, maybe around low single digits between 1-5%. Now this is important because even with all this revenue growth (and if you disagree with me and think it will even be higher), you still need to achieve big margins on your business. I mean really really good margins, we are talking about 15-25% each year. Interestingly, AMZN, while growing its top line crazily over the years and becoming a behemoth as it is today, always lacked in terms of their margins. That goes without saying they are a tech company that typically exhibit great returns on capital. So the point is they had to sacrifice their margins to be able to achieve this growth and this is an important point.

In my DCF, I am extremely generous. I kept TSLA's EBITDA margins at 15% for the next 3 years, bumped to 17.5%, 20.0%, then to finally 25.0% every 3 years in going forward. Once again these regulatory credits will not be there forever so those margins are extremely optimistic at this point. They might indeed achieve 25% margins in 10 years or so but it won't be this smooth.

With these two major factors, other items in the DCF are not super important. The discount rate is 8.0%, which I believe is reasonable, NWC and Capex assumptions are in line with what they are today and I don't think they would necessarily go down (if not go up). I just want to mention that you may completely disagree with some of the assumptions I outlined above. The point however is no matter what sort of DCF you come up with, you will end up either with lower or slight higher value for TSLA, using very, very aggressive assumptions for 10+ years. So the point and question is around the **margin of safety** here.

It seems I can't directly post pictures so here is the link for the DCF:

[https://ibb.co/mSHDcBh](https://ibb.co/mSHDcBh)

You might wonder, well your price is even higher than what it is today so why did you write this.

Once again my whole point in the argument was that the margin of error in TSLA's stock price right now is non-existent, because we've already treated it the next AMZN, gave the best margins possible, attributed big bucks on its other stuff. I think my DCF is still in the unreasonable side, but I wanted to point this out that even a s*light change in trajectory would mean a totally different path and stock price for TSLA.*

So the question is, are we ahead of ourselves with TSLA? This could also apply to others as well, this so called growth companies. It is as if we are pricing everything today and think that they have already achieved incredible market share in everything they touched and it's only a matter of time that these revenue/profits are realized. Are we taking one anomaly and applying this rationale for every other great company under the name of ""it's tech""? Elon is great and TSLA will be great. But the business model may not just allow them to be the next AMZN, regardless of technology or improvement.

One final comment I will make is related to autonomous driving and data TSLA is collecting. While it is for certain that this data gives TSLA an incredible power in developing this technology, I see couple of issues with this as it relates to future of this thing.

Companies such as Facebook are big not because of their software, but because of the network effects they exhibit. And because of those network effects they become larger and larger and are able to collect more data, which creates an incredibly profitable cycle for them as they can monetize that data right away. Data for TSLA here only matters in developing that technology. Monetization however, is another story.

What I am not entirely sure with all this AI story is that if it needs to continuously get updated for use, then how do regulators/companies determine the older version was safe to use to begin with. What I understand is that AI is something that needs to get constantly updated based on data, challenge here is that you are carrying people's lives here (as opposed to targeting ads) so there needs to be an infliction point where the full autonomous driving AI software should be at a point where it is certainly 100% safe to use. Because if it is not, then the technology fails until it reaches to that point. If it does reach out to that point, then how difficult is it going to be for others to get to that point or use similar technology if what you need is to get from point A to B safely.

Besides there is the price factor in as well. Let's say TSLA is the only one who can do this. If autonomous driving is too expensive, then how much will people pay for it? Say if the car is 50k and you have to pay extra 50k on top of that - would you do this? Would this have a cannibalization effect? Or if it is monthly subscription fees, would you go on to pay this forever? How significant will the cost be in 20 years from now when others presumably also start providing some sort of service.

On the other hand, if it is not expensive and only a fraction of the car price, then how are you going to achieve these growth levels with that data and technology to begin with. It is one thing to have a great technology, another to monetize it. They might license it for sure, but then you lose all that power right away. So the question then becomes, will it be a niche product or commodity at the end of the day - either of which will not allow you to have incredible returns.

I can't say if another one is looming, near, or not close at all. My ability to predict the market is as bad as anyone's.

However, hearing all the fear and hype, and seeing the Great Flight to bonds and commodities and other instruments, it causes me to reflect on what I see happening now, vs. what I remember from the past.

So, when real recessions were underway here's what I remember:

1. People were not universally warning me to avoid stocks. If anything, bubble hype was so great that I was told I ""couldn't lose"" by investing in tech, or real estate, or whatever else was fashionable at the time. I remember one friend actually becoming angry when I suggested that real estate was as susceptible to market uncertainty as anything else.

2. My company stopped giving out bonuses and raises, for years. People were laid off during successive waves of ""restructuring"". Recruiters called less often. Jobs were harder to find. Many of my friends had difficulty finding new work, or were out of jobs for months. There was a feeling of things ""drying up"".

3. During the last recession, Europe became rather expensive to visit (1.47 EUR/USD in Dec 2008). In general, purchasing power felt like it was... less, though this could have just been psychological.

In short, the recession environment made life feel like it was becoming more difficult. Whereas in the current climate, borrowing is still easy, interest rates are low, recruiters are calling, companies  pay competitively, my friends are taking trips and vacations and spending their money. The only place I notice ""recession"" cropping up is in the news, over and over.

I'm hopeful it stays there, but it makes me wonder how much of this is just fear levels reaching a fever pitch. Which could, I imagine, provoke the very thing everyone is afraid of, if the market depreciates assets too severely and everyone begins to panic.",2019-08-19 07:36:52

Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had a stark message for a private audience: As bad as things have been for corporate America in recent weeks, they’re likely to get worse.

Mass bankruptcies, empty planes, cautious consumers and an increase in the corporate tax rate to as high as 29% were part of a vision Fink sketched out on a call this week. The message from the leader of the world’s biggest asset manager contrasts with the ebullient tones of a stock market that has snapped back from recent lows.


Even among Wall Street luminaries, Fink speaks with particular clout. He has been advising President Donald Trump on how to navigate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. And BlackRock is playing a key role in the Federal Reserve’s efforts to stabilize markets, helping the central bank buy billions of dollars in assets.

Fink said on the call with clients of a wealth advisory firm that bankers have told him they expect a cascade of bankruptcies to hit the American economy, and he wondered if the Fed needed to do more to provide support, according to a person with knowledge of the remarks.

A BlackRock spokesman declined to comment.

Even as the U.S. is plunged into deepening economic gloom, it will have to raise taxes to pay for emergency efforts to rescue sectors grappling with a difficult recovery, he warned on the call.

Among his predictions: lifting the 21% corporate rate signed into law as part of 2017’s tax overhaul to about 28% or 29% next year, according to the person. Fink also said he sees tax rates for individuals going up.

​Raising taxes would water down the biggest legislative achievement of Trump’s time in office, when he and a Republican-controlled Congress drove through the most significant changes to the tax code in decades.

Lower corporate rates juiced profits and showered cash on shareholders through increased dividends and stock buybacks. Now, at a time when many taxpayers are less able to bear the burden of higher taxes, the government may be forced to extract a larger share of companies’ and individuals’ income.

The spread of the coronavirus, and measures taken to mitigate it, slammed the brakes on the economy. While Trump pushes to reopen commerce and his officials predict a rapid rebound, public health experts and some economists are skeptical the crisis will soon be over.

Politicians, business leaders and economists are beginning to confront the risks of a limited federal response that might speed up the demise of smaller companies and wreck state and municipal finances that pay for schools, law enforcement and infrastructure.

That won’t be the only strain on companies. Many may have to operate with only about half their staff in the office for more than a year, according to Fink. Across white-collar industries, millions are working remotely from home. It would be hard to see a complete return without mass availability of rapid testing, he said.

There’s a risk that the U.S. outbreak will be severe enough to leave a long-lasting impact on the American psyche, undermining Americans’ willingness to take public transport or fly, according to Fink. He said he’s not aware of any of his CEO peers planning international travel this year.

Underscoring the point, this week home-sharing leader Airbnb Inc. and ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc. announced plans for mass layoffs as they wrestle with falling demand and dimmed prospects for the rest of the year.

Many of the U.S.’s 30 million small businesses have struggled to get the relief they need. If the crisis continues, about 25% of those companies could close permanently before year-end, according to an April report released by Main Street America, a network comprising approximately 300,000 small businesses.

Restaurants that typically operate with thin margins will struggle to survive as they plot out ways to lure back customers with social-distancing measures in place, Fink said.

Fink also said he was concerned the worsening economic duress could further fan the flames of nationalism. The devastating impact from the coronavirus could make it a bigger threat to the global order, he said.

This article is definitely concerning and brings up some good points. I don’t know that you can bet on tripling your investment, but I feel safe assuming that it’ll grow considerably given that many people’s current cost basis is based on the fire sale that the COVID recession brought at the beginning. And really the market is doing so bad right now because COVID cases are rising because it’s winter, but once it starts to heat up and COVID cases aren’t spiking the way they currently are I’m sure the market will regain some territory - or at least not be pinned down the way it currently is. And it seems like his assessment was generally a response to the conventional advice that you can guarantee returns by investing in an index fund that follows the S&P 500 or investing in the big tech companies (and there is definitely a concern that they could be harmed by anti-trust suits). But I think it depends on what you’re investing in. 

Like if you’re in airlines they’re directly affected, probably more than any other industry, by COVID restrictions. Their earnings have been shit because of it and once people aren’t afraid to travel I just don’t see how their earnings and then share value don’t go up. If you wanted to hedge against the sort of losses he talks about I would probably sell once they start announcing vaccines coming out because I’d be surprised if the market didn’t drive prices up with their optimism that that means everything is going back to normal. On top of that, when he says that the market in 2012 still wasn’t above its 2000 peak it’s a bit disingenuous because when you look at the S&P over the past 20 years he’s right, but 2000 was a peak (at about 1491), then after a dip, the market went to a high of about 1535 in 2007, then the market crashed in 08 and started recovering and he just picked an arbitrary point in that recovery that proved his point but which became irrelevant the very next year, in 2013, when the market DID exceed 2000 levels and then boomed over the next 7 years to more than double what it was in 2000 or 2006.

Regarding what he said about big tech companies, yeah I would probably stay out of tech. Those companies already have such a high share price that I’ve always been skeptical of jumping in anyway. He also says globalization is in retreat, and I think that’s a bit of a hasty conclusion. I think we’re definitely at a crossroads where we’re trying to determine if we’re going to dive headfirst into a more globalist orientation or retreat and be more isolationist, but I’m skeptical that in the longer term we aren’t going to be more globalist in orientation. But I do think we’re in for a bit of identity seeking as it pertains to whether we’re going to be more globalist or isolationist, because if you recall TPP had pretty steep opposition on both sides of the aisle - but not so much that Obama wasn’t willing to pursue it. And I think the luster of isolationism has probably been tarnished a bit by Trump. Though globalism is really one of those things, just like anti-racism and shit like that, where this election seems to sort of serve as a referendum on it. 

Trump is certainly not a fan of globalism, but Biden seems at least more globally oriented and has at least in some cases shown an inclination towards reviving Obama-era policies that Trump dismantled because Biden was part of the Obama era so his legacy is sorta tied up in that as well, and one of those policies was TPP. As far as workers demanding a fairer split of capitalism, that’s fair. I do anticipate things like wage hikes, but that could also result in people spending more because they have more (i.e. Keynesianism). I also think it’s a fair point about the aging demographics thing. It makes sense that boomers would want to divest themselves of riskier stocks and people just haven’t been having kids as much as they used to, so the working-age population is surely going to feel that bite at some point (though I’m not sure when). However, the US has long been an exception to the rule of shitty population growth rates in the west. In general, we don’t have a ton of kids, but where we have historically differed is that we attract a lot of immigrants so our population grows that way - and Biden has already stated that he’s going to be reversing some of Trump’s immigration policies.

Robinhood day traders swarmed to Eastman Kodak Co. shares as the stock rallied 1,600% this week.

As of 11 a.m. in New York on Wednesday, 43,000 users of the investing app had added [Kodak](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/KODK:US) to their accounts in some form over the past 24 hours, according to website Robintrack.net, which aggregates data from the brokerage but isn’t affiliated with it. The activity was 20 times more than the next most-popular stock, Actinium Pharmaceuticals Inc. Roughly 27,000 of the additions came over a four-hour span earlier Wednesday.

 

The growing presence of retail investors has become a popular markets narrative this year with zero commission fees and the potential for entertainment in a world largely without sports or gambling luring a new crop of traders. The impact they have on prices is unclear, but similar buying sprees have erupted in pockets of the equity market, including electric-vehicle firms, shares of companies in bankruptcy protection and increasingly pharmaceutical stocks.

This weekend alone, D+ downloads rose +68% due to Mulan. Most importantly, with D+ launch access to Mulan at $30, they have complete ownership of all sales instead of sharing it with movie theaters. Consumer spending inside the D+ app spiked 193% this weekend. Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/mulan-disney-plus-downloads-68-percent-weekend-194701349.html

They are a lockdown play, a post-lockdown play, and a vaccine play. At every moment, they have a winning play and are highly differentiated with every competitor.

792,Chinese Auditors Are on the Hook After Clients Are Caught Cooking the Books: “There has long been suspicion that Chinese companies have a tendency to fabricate results when necessary. And that seems to be a well-grounded concern”,1189,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cl687n/chinese_auditors_are_on_the_hook_after_clients/,192,"SHANGHAI—An accounting scandal has disrupted dozens of initial public offerings and other fundraising plans in China, intensifying investor concerns about the amount of trust they can place in audited financial results in the country.

In recent weeks, a string of Chinese companies have halted financing plans, with many saying the China Securities Regulatory Commission was investigating their auditor, Ruihua Certified Public Accountants, for suspected violation of securities law. The regulator and Ruihua officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The apparent investigation into Ruihua, China’s second-largest homegrown accounting firm by revenue, follows revelations of overstated earnings by a client.

In May, the securities commission began a probe of Ruihua’s smaller rival GP Certified Public Accountants Co., after finding that GP client Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co. had inflated cash holdings by more than $4 billion.

With economic growth at its slowest since at least 1992, investors and analysts say many companies are experiencing financial distress, which in turn is revealing accounting problems that were easier to hide when credit was freely available and businesses were growing rapidly.

Beijing is probably also pressuring accountants to be more rigorous, they say, especially since foreign investors are now playing a larger role in China’s financial markets.

Economic and market weakness has prompted greater scrutiny of listed companies and auditors, as regulators seek to contain financial risk and “purify the market environment,” said Landing Zhang, chief executive of Shanghai asset-management firm CYAMLAN Investment.

The reliability of financial statements is one of several challenges facing investors in China. There are also question marks over the quality of local credit ratings and official economic data, while critical commentary by analysts and investors is often censored.

Chinese bookkeeping is also a sore point in Washington, since Beijing doesn’t allow U.S. authorities to inspect audits of Chinese companies listed in New York.

“There has long been suspicion that Chinese companies have a tendency to fabricate results when necessary. And that seems to be a well-grounded concern,” said Paul Gillis, an accounting professor at Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management.

Mr. Gillis said part of the reason is that it is extremely difficult to bet against companies by selling stocks short in China. “It’s short sellers who tend to identify most of the fraudulent companies because they have the incentives to do so.”

Auditors declined to endorse—or endorsed only partially—a record 219 annual reports last year, nearly double the 113 in the previous year, according to Wind Information Co., a data provider. These actions suggest an auditor has found issues with the results or has doubts about the company’s status as a going concern.

Earlier this year, the securities commission found a Ruihua client, Kangde Xin Composite Material Group Co., had overstated profits for the four years through 2018 by $1.7 billion. After endorsing Kangde Xin’s financial statements for three years, Ruihua said it couldn’t express any opinion about the most recent annual report. Ruihua has said it completely fulfilled its auditing duties.

Since then, at least 23 listed companies that are Ruihua clients have flagged delays to refinancing plans, which can mean selling shares or convertible bonds, as have 28 IPO candidates. The Shanghai Stock Exchange has also postponed reviews of four Ruihua-linked applications to list on its new Science and Technology Innovation Board.

This is isn’t the first time Ruihua and peers have gotten into trouble. In 2017, the Ministry of Finance and the CSRC suspended Ruihua and rival BDO China from auditing public companies for roughly two months, according to the ministry’s website, after each was hit by two disciplinary actions within two years.

Ruihua was also fined by the market regulator in December 2018 because of problems with a client’s annual reports, and three years ago, served a one-year ban for some work related to the interbank bond market, after failing to assist a regulatory probe into a client that defaulted.

The local arms of international accountancy networks are the largest players in China, but vie with many local outfits, to whom they have lost market share in recent years, according to the Asian Corporate Governance Association.

Firms affiliated with the Big Four—PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Ernst & Young and KPMG—and midtier player BDO are the five largest players.

Their combined revenue made up 26% of the total Chinese accounting market, according to a 2018 report by the Chinese Institute of Certified Public Accountants. In the U.S., arms of the Big Four and BDO audit about half of all listed companies, according to Audit Analytics.

Amy Lin, a Shanghai-based senior analyst at Capital Securities, said the cost of breaking the law was too low in China. The maximum fine for false financial disclosures is 600,000 yuan ($87,000), while the top criminal punishment for hiding or destroying accounting records is a prison term of five years and a fine of up to 200,000 yuan.

On July 26, the market regulator said it would increase prison terms and fines for capital-markets misdeeds, and would revoke licenses of intermediaries, including accounting firms, that failed to fulfill their duties.

“The authorities have a clear intention to use the outburst of financial fraud as an opportunity to clean up the market, partly because they have limited capacity to bail out all the troubled companies,” said Shen Meng, director at Chanson & Co., a Beijing-based boutique investment bank.

Like many other investors, I rapidly became overwhelmed with the uncertainty in the future. Consequently I decided to focus in on what we know now with high probability. Essentially this is assuming all fiscal / monetary policies as currently enacted and consensus estimates on COVID-19 mitigation (i.e. gradual resumption of normal commerce after mid to late Q2). See more detailed assumptions later. 

&nbsp;


Some facts going into the analysis:

* 2019 saw a ~30% gain in the S&P 500, however corporate earnings were nearly flat. Consequently, the 30% rise in the S&P 500 was due almost entirely to increases in valuation, i.e. stock investors paying more for future earnings
* The OECD had projected in September 2019 3.0% Global GDP growth and 2.0% for the US. This was already a deceleration of global growth from 3.6% worldwide in 2018 and 2.9% in the US.
* US Manufacturing, according to the ISM and IHS Markit surveys, weakened through most of 2019 (although showed a slight rebound near the end of year)
* US Business investment also declined through much of 2019, potentially due to the ""trade war"" between the China & the US
* US Consumer spending remained robust throughout 2019, although also appeared to decelerate near the end of 2019 / early 2020. 
* US households had modestly de-leveraged as a % of GDP since 2008, and the debt servicing costs (due to lower interest rates) were at historic lows at the end of 2019. It’s worth noting the changing composition of household debt, with strong increases in student loan and auto debt while mortgage debt decreased. Housing debt peaked at ~$10 trillion in 2008, compared to slightly less than ~$10 trillion at the end of 2019. However, non-housing debt peaked at ~$2.7 trillion in 2008, while by 2019 non-housing debt stood at $4.2 trillion
* US Corporate debt stood at record levels as compared to GDP: ~75%. This debt had also deteriorated in ratings with the largest percentage in history rated as slightly above junk (BBB)
* The US deficit for fiscal year 2019 was estimated at ~$1 trillion pre-COVID
* The bulk of net inflows from 2016-2019 into US equities have been driven by stock buybacks. Since 2009, companies have spent ~$5 trillion in share buybacks

&nbsp;


In short, my analysis is that the US economy entered 2020 with modest to low growth prospects. While consumer spending and household debt servicing costs remained bright spots, modest wage gains coupled with high housing, education, and healthcare costs presented a mixed picture. Both business investment and manufacturing activity were subdued, although hopes for a ""Phase 1"" trade war seemed cause for modest optimism. 

&nbsp;

With those facts as background, here are my baked in assumptions for the following analysis:

* The OECD nations + major developing countries (China, etc.) modestly resume normal economic activity in mid to late Q2

* There is no vaccine or ""miracle drug"" until late 2020 / 2021
* Stimulus from major central banks globally prevents an immediate financial crisis or severe market distortions (e.g. the corporate credit market seizing up)
* Additional fiscal stimulus measures, while substantial, do not exceed the original stimulus bills (e.g. the $2.2 trillion US bill)
* The COVID-19 lockdown contributes to a severe recession in Q1/Q2 2020 in most countries, but the easing of lockdown measures + stimulus leads to modest to substantial recovery in Q3 2020. 

&nbsp;


Alright, onto the main event. Here is what I think is ""baked"" into the future assuming the above events:

* Dramatic increases in sovereign debt levels. The US alone is estimated to run a deficit of ~$3-4 trillion depending on the severity and duration of the recession. With global debt levels already at records highs, it is unclear what effect these substantial debt levels will have (deflation, inflation, stagflation, no effect?) 

* Severe budget deficits in US state & local governments. Increased spending on unemployment insurance and healthcare expenditures coupled with decreased revenues will force states to significantly cut their budgets. These cuts will include layoffs of non-essential employees. 
* Increased pressure on Euro zone economies, particularly Italy. Italian economic growth remained anemic in 2019 at 0.3%. With the complete lockdown of the Italian economy (which began in the economic engine of Northern Italy), Italy will likely face dramatic declines in GDP and correspondingly large government deficits. Northern Eurozone countries will be faced yet again with difficult choices with regards to Italian debt. Pressure from northern Eurozone countries on Italy risk furthering inflaming public opinion and leading to a separatist backlash. 
* Negative to zero growth in US consumer spending in 2020. Despite the enhanced unemployment insurance, stimulus checks, and corporate / small biz loans I believe it is unlikely that consumer spending will rebound in 2020. Consumers will prioritize on paying off debts, rebuilding savings, etc. due to the economic uncertainty. Furthermore there is permanent demand destruction in certain sectors, e.g. consumers are unlikely to replace all of their canceled vacations, restaurant visits, shopping excursions, etc. The ""wealth effect"" will work in reverse as many high income households see drops in both their investments accounts as well as variable compensation: bonuses, pay raises, RSUs, stock options, etc. 
* Unemployment will remain substantially elevated over its early 2020 low of ~3.5% through 2020. As in 2009, many corporations will ""do more with less"" in lieu of hiring during uncertain times. Small and medium sized businesses will face substantial revenue losses in 2020 and will focus on cutting costs to remain solvent. 
* Manufacturing and business investment will remain weak in 2020. Manufacturing will continue to stagnant due to sluggish demand for automobiles, aircraft, and other durable goods. Businesses will focus on preserving cash, paying down / refinancing debts, etc. due to weak global demand
* The US Federal Reserve will continue to support markets with QE and other monetary policy measures. 
* Increased likelihood of a change in US presidential administrations. In early 2020 the Democratic party appeared poised to nominate a progressive, divisive candidate in Bernie Sanders. By April 2020 Joe Biden, a center-left candidate, had secured the nomination. At the same time, the US economic outlook had substantially deteriorated. While the economy is likely to improve in the June-November timeline, it is unclear if this recovery will be substantial enough to allow President Trump to run on a message of economic recovery. The increased likelihood of a Democratic presidential administration is a corresponding decreased likelihood of further US corporate tax cuts.
* Dramatic decrease in stock buybacks in 2020. Companies will focus on preserving cash and reducing debt levels. 
* Significant deployment of ""dry powder"" from cash rich corporates and private equity firms (which have ~$2+ trillion in unallocated funds). These funds will look for opportunities in distressed credit, M&A, and other opportunistic areas
* Continued low oil prices in 2020. While a modest recovery is possible, the magnitude of demand destruction for oil, the unraveling of Opec+, and the continuing impact of American shale drillers will contain price growth. 
* Continued China - US tension. There is little sign of a thaw in relations, and a hard line against China is one of the few popular bi-partisan issues in US domestic politics. Initial discussions to suspend Chinese tariffs during the crisis seem to have stalled.
* Emphasis on supply chain resiliency / diversification. Between the US - China trade war and the COVID-19 outbreak, OECD companies will face both investor and political pressure to diversify their supply chain away from China. This will bolster the slow and gradual shift that was already underway due to increasing Chinese labor costs and the perception of an opaque, unfair legal regime. In the short term this will drive up costs (China is a manufacturing hub for many reasons beyond cheap labor) which will either compress corporate profits or raise consumer prices.  
* Unlike 2009, there does not appear to be a new global engine of growth. China seems justifiably concerned about exacerbating their debt situation with massive fiscal stimulus. India was already experiencing a recession, and other major economies like Nigeria, Indonesia, etc. do not have the per capita purchasing power to stimulate global growth. Many of these countries are also suffering from the collapse in commodity prices and the flight from emerging market bonds / equities. 

&nbsp;


I hesitate to forecast the future, because obviously there is significant uncertainty. However, my personal base case is that an immediate ""V-shaped"" recovery in asset prices is unlikely. For asset prices to reach or exceed 2020 levels would require corporates to either substantially increase earnings in mid to late 2020 AND investors to value future earnings at the same high levels of 2020. However, it is worth noting that the record low interest rates (and corresponding bond yields) and monetary easing could in theory drive investors into equities, real estates, private equity, etc. as the only option for positive returns. My personal base case is a sluggish recovery in mid to late 2020 with asset prices remaining volatile to shifts in sentiment. With the Fed stabilizing markets, a widespread global depression seems unlikely but could occur if high global debt levels trigger widespread corporate bankruptcies or some form of ""stagflation"". Another unlikely, but possible case is that the world emulates Japan after the early 1990s and experiences a long period of slow asset price decline as corporates deleverage, credit availability declines modestly, and no new global engines of growth emerge. 

&nbsp;


Thoughts?

&nbsp;


Edit #2: Adding in how to know I'm wrong


One thing that occurred to me is that since this analysis is slightly bearish, I should proactively offer some data points that would indicate I'm wrong / overly pessimistic:

* Rapid recovery in US consumer spending in Q3 / Q4 2020 to pre-COVID levels
* Rapid return to pre-COVID employment, ~3.5%, by Q4 2020 
* Increased US business investment / manufacturing activity in Q3 / Q4 to supplement or replace consumer spending
* The rapid return of the US corporate debt market which enables large stock buybacks in Q4 2020 onward
* Corporate earnings growth compared to late 2019 (i.e. not simply quarter on quarter comparisons against the likely awful Q1 / Q2 numbers)
* Massive US government infrastructure projects / other stimulus programs that generate demand and boost US household incomes 

Edit #3: Some people have correctly pointed out that India was not in a recession in 2019. Apologies, I should have said that growth had decelerated over 2019, with Q4 2019 growth estimated at ~4.7% compared to GDP of ~7% in 2018. I think my larger point stands that India's economy did not appear to be trending in a positive direction, and given their per capita income of ~$1700 4.7% is not sufficient to dramatically improve global growth.

PayPal Holdings Inc. is exploring acquisitions of cryptocurrency companies including Bitcoin custodian BitGo Inc., according to people familiar with the matter, a move that would expand its embrace of digital coins.

PayPal has been holding talks with BitGo, a company that helps investors store Bitcoin securely, and could reach a deal within weeks, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Talks could still fall apart and PayPal could opt to buy other targets, the people added.

It couldn’t be learned how much PayPal would pay for BitGo if it goes ahead with the deal. BitGo raised $58.5 million in 2018 at a $170 million valuation, according to PitchBook.

Representatives for BitGo and PayPal declined to comment.

Palo Alto, California-based BitGo was founded in 2013 by Chief Executive Officer Mike Belshe. It offers digital wallets that require multiple signatures for transactions, as well as offline vaults for storing Bitcoin and rival currencies. It was one of the first companies in the space to focus on institutional investors, according to its website.

The company applied in August to New York regulators to become an independent, regulated qualified custodian under New York State Banking Law, a press release showed. Custodians like BitCoin are responsible for safekeeping digital assets using secure storage.

PayPal announced on Wednesday that its customers can buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin from digital wallets, as well as use the virtual money to shop at the 26 million merchants on its network. The announcement led Bitcoin to surge past $13,000 for the first time since July 2019.

PayPal said it would partner with BitGo competitor Paxos Trust Company, a regulated provider of cryptocurrency products and services for its new service.

BitGo is backed by investors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Craft Ventures, Digital Currency Group, DRW, Galaxy Digital Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, Valor Equity Partners and Founders Fund.",2020-10-23 21:39:39

* 1 in 6 publicly traded U.S. companies did not earn enough to cover their interest payments before the COVID-19 crises. 
* In the first half of 2019, 40% of all leveraged loans went to companies with a debt-to-earnings ratio of 6:1 or higher.

> **Since the disease's spread has intensified, the U.S. central bank has enacted an emergency interest rate of 50 basis points, opened up a liquidity program to the bank to add up to $1.5 trillion to the financial system and started buying government debt across the yield curve.**

> Trump said he is not yet looking at removing Jerome Powell as chairman, though he believes he has the right to do so. He has harshly criticized Powell previously, saying the Fed should be more aggressive in easing the stance of monetary policy.

> **""I have the right to remove him. No, I'm not doing that,"" Trump said. ""I also have the right to put him in a regular position and put someone else in charge, and I haven't made any decisions on that.""**

> Trump likely could move Powell out as chairman. Powell's term as governor runs until 2026; Trump would need cause to remove him from that position.

Market pricing points to the Federal Open Market Committee taking the rate to near-zero, where it was during and after the financial crisis.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced a new proposal on Tuesday, which could allow companies like Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER) and LYFT Inc (NASDAQ: LYFT), and DoorDash to compensate gig economy workers in equity.

What Happened: The regulator has proposed a pilot program for tech aggregators that hire gig economy workers or drivers, under which the companies can pay up to 15% of the worker compensation (not exceeding $75,000 in three years) in stock rather than cash.

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton clarified the rationale behind the proposal by saying work relationships have evolved along with technology, and gig economy workers are a vital cog in the broader U.S. economy's growth.

The proposal will be open to a 60-day public comment period and may come into force only under the new leadership chosen by President-elect Joe Biden.

Why It Matters: California attorney general had sued both Uber and Lyft earlier this year for not following the California Assembly Bill 5, which forced aggregators to reclassify workers as employees, making them entitled to similar benefits. However, the ride-hailing companies won the Proposition 22 referendum that exempts it from reclassifying gig workers. 

In a bid to garner support for the referendum, the companies had guaranteed other benefits such as health insurance for drivers who work 15 hours or more a week, occupational-accident insurance coverage, and 30 cents for every mile driven, among other protections.",2020-11-25 22:37:00

I recently put together the following portfolio, with the intention of not touching it for at least 10 years. Discuss your opinions in the comments, I'd be glad to hear your feedback!

1) Amazon: 25%

I feel like Amazon can't be stopped in the 2020s, it will completely obliberate every company who can't innovate and put their customers first. I've recently read the book ""bezonomics"" and I suggest everyone who doesn't fully understand this company to read it aswell. Amazon is number 1 by far in e-commerce and cloud computing, industries that are still very young and have a lot of potential. However, the thing I like most about Amazon is its ability to innovate and how they are able to ""spread their wings"" in every segment where there is money to be made.

2) Microsoft: 15%

This one is pretty obvious and boring. Microsoft has always been a solid company, they have been through many freefalls of the tech market so that is a factor to keep in mind. Their new cloud computing platform ""Azure"" looks very promising, being the second biggest in the world (behind Amazon.) Microsoft has a very diversed business model and a good management team so they are not going anywhere.

3) Apple: 10%

Apple is a very high quality company, with a fairly low PE ratio compared to other tech. I also feel like the rise of 5G is only going to make Apple stronger. 

4) Alibaba: 10%

I can't forget about this Chinese tech giant! The growth in chinese consumer spending makes this stock really attractive to me. Alibaba pretty much has a monopoly in China concerning e-commerce and cloud computing services ( comparable to Amazon in the US.)

5) Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: 10%

This company has many rather defensive stocks that will help the firm through recessions and economic downfalls, but this company will also keep riding the upward market trends. Berkshire is a great stabilizer that will round out your portfolio beautifully. One of the best long-term stocks in my opinion.

5) Disney: 5%

This entertainment giant is still trading at a discount price and is set for a comeback rally any time soon, with the parks reopening etc. The company also pays a respectable amount of dividend, currently yielding at 1.62%.

6) Walmart: 5%

Walmart is often overlooked by investors, because of Amazon, but I strongly believe Walmart isn't going anywhere and is one of the few companies that won't get eaten by Amazon. Walmart also recently launched an e-commerce platform, trying to compete with Amazon. The company also pays a good dividend of 1.64%.

7) Coca-Cola: 5%

A personal favorite of mine, Coca-Cola! One of the strongest and most reliable brands in the world and my favorite dividend king. I love the current discount on this one, trading at 75% of its ATH. The dividend yield 3,5% is beautiful.

8)  PepsiCo: 5%

I feel like if I'm going to be adding Coca-Cola to my portfolio, I can't forget about PepsiCo. These 2 beverage giants are not going anywhere. The dividend yield of 3% is nice aswell.

9)  Johnson & Johnson: 5%

Even though I don't know much about pharmaceutical stocks, I still love JNJ, mostly because of their growing dividend payout (for over 50+ years!)

10)  McDonald's: 5%

My favorite fast food chain can't lack this portfolio.  When it comes to fast-casual dining, McDonald's is still the kingpin, and it's likely going to stay that way for a long time to come. The growing dividend payout (for 43 consecutive years) also looks really appealing to me.

The U.S. budget gap widened to more than $1 trillion in the first 11 months of the fiscal year, the first time deficits have topped that mark since 2012

WASHINGTON—The U.S. budget gap widened to more than $1 trillion in the first 11 months of the fiscal year, the Treasury Department said Thursday, the first time year-to-date deficits have topped that amount in seven years.

Higher spending on the military, rising interest expenses on government debt and weak revenues early in the fiscal year combined to push the deficit up 19% from October through August, compared with the same period a year earlier. Government spending climbed 7%, to $4.1 trillion, outpacing higher federal tax receipts, which grew 3%, to $3.1 trillion.

That brought the total deficit to $1.07 trillion so far in fiscal 2019, which started Oct. 1, or 4.4% as a share of gross domestic product.

The last time the U.S. recorded a budget gap of that magnitude in the first 11 months of the fiscal year was in August 2012, when the deficit totaled $1.16 trillion, a period when the U.S. was still climbing out of a deep recession. Deficits began to decline soon after amid concerns about rising red ink, after Republicans and Democrats agreed to cut spending and let certain tax cuts expire.

No such agreement is on the horizon now, and forecasters project trillion-dollar annual deficits for decades to come.

A strong economy typically leads to narrower deficits, as rising household income and corporate profits help boost tax collections, while spending on safety-net programs such as unemployment insurance tends to decline.

The U.S. economy has been growing for 10 years as of July, the longest economic expansion on record. Yet annual U.S. deficits are on track to exceed $1 trillion starting this year, due in part to the 2017 tax law, which constrained federal revenue collection last year, and a 2018 budget deal that busted spending caps enacted in 2011.

Senior Treasury officials attributed this year’s higher deficit primarily to a surge in government spending, and emphasized that federal revenues have climbed nearly 7% since May, in large part reflecting a robust economy and low unemployment. Corporate tax revenue in particular has rebounded in recent months, after a period when analysts were unsure why it was running below Congressional Budget Office projections.

Still, revenue growth has continued to lag the broader economy, and is below where forecasters projected it would be prior to the 2017 tax cuts.

Federal spending has continued to climb. The Treasury said Thursday spending on the military and interest costs on government debt each rose 9% from October through August, and Medicare expenses increased 10%.

It’s not yet clear whether the deficit will exceed $1 trillion for the full fiscal year, because the government usually collects more revenue in September than it spends, which could bring the overall figure down. The White House Office of Management and Budget in July projected the deficit would hit $1 trillion by the end of September, while the CBO last month said it expected a total deficit of $960 billion in fiscal 2019.

Rising deficits have led the Treasury to ramp up borrowing in recent years. The government said it expected to borrow more than $1 trillion for the second year in a row in 2019. Government debt held by the public has risen from $14.4 trillion at the start of the Trump administration, to nearly $17 trillion today, a 19% increase.

President Trump and Congress have reached a spending deal that avoids a crisis on the debt ceiling but adds significantly to the federal budget deficit. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains why the new agreement may focus attention on runaway government spending. Photo: AP (Originally published July 24, 2019)
Markets have responded to the increased issuance with a shrug, and interest rates remain at historic lows amid steady demand from investors. Still, a swelling debt load has increased the government’s debt-servicing costs, one of the fastest-growing parts of the budget.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday the government was considering financing options that could reduce borrowing costs, including introducing a 50-year bond and lengthening the maturity of Treasury borrowing.

President Trump, as part of his pressure campaign on Federal Reserve policy makers, argued on Wednesday that further short-term rate cuts would also help lower government borrowing costs.

Reacting on Twitter to a rate cut by the European Central Bank on Thursday morning, Mr. Trump said of European governments: “They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest!”

Some economists are skeptical that pushing interest rates to zero, as he called for, would lead to lower interest costs on government debt.

More broadly, annual deficits are projected to more than double as a share of the economy over the coming decades, as a wave of retiring baby boomers pushes up federal spending on retirement and health-care benefits.

CBO last month increased its expectations for deficits over the next decade after Congress and the White House reached a new two-year budget deal that would boost federal spending more than $300 billion above spending caps enacted in 2011.

The deal will add roughly $1.7 trillion to deficits between 2020 and 2029, assuming federal spending continues to rise by the rate of inflation beyond 2021. Much of that increase will be offset, however, by lower-than-expected interest rates, which will reduce the cost of servicing the government’s swelling debt by $1.4 trillion over the next decade, the CBO said.",2019-09-13 06:35:24

Don’t just read articles and blog posts that confirm your view about a company. ***Right  now a lot of $TSLA & $NKLA shareholders are mad about shortsellers  going after their stock but in fact you should embrace it.***

Shortsellers do research that you could ***never do on your own***.  In fact I would love it if someone would give me a 50 page report on  everything thats wrong with any of my holdings. I know whats right about  all the companies I own. What I want to know are the flaws, the  accounting issues ( if there are any ) etc.

With Luckin Coffee Muddy Waters Research bought thousands of cups of  coffee from different branches and kept an eye on the customers. Thats  invaluable research and in the end they were right that the numbers  don’t match up. 

They probably saved a lot of Luckin Coffee Shareholders from bigger  losses ( those who read the report). And of course short sellers should  get compensated for this work. There have to be incentives to do this  kind of work. Else nobody would do it. Don’t count on auditors which are  incentivized to look the other way and keep a paying client.When you’re  an analyst you can just say you think revenue will go up but you don’t  need to back it up. 

Thats it. But when you accuse someone of fraud then you better have a  lot of evidence to support this view. Short sellers face potential  losses & lawsuit. If they are wrong they lose a lot. Thats why they  work hard and only release reports when they have enough to back up  their claim. Also what do Companies like Nikola have to worry about ? If  everything is fine then the Hindenburg report will turn out false and  they continue to enjoy a rising share price. **But what if the report is right?**

If you are a Nikola shareholder then you should pay attention to it.  Read it and work this into your thesis for owning the stock. Is it worth  the risk? Maybe limit your exposure.But don’t ridicule the people that  release those reports. There is a lot of hard work & money behind  it.

***Short sellers don’t do this for the fun of it.***  And if they are right they should be compensated for their work. I  would actually say that many short sellers work much harder on research  than a long analyst. After all they have to be right to make money. If  they’re wrong they won’t be able to enjoy market returns. They would  literally get wiped out.

I buy several times a week from them but I'm the biggest enemy of Amazon Choice and Best Seller .
I used to sort by reviews/stars but now sends you to unrelated items. Even though many fake reviews. 

LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators have filed antitrust charges against Amazon, accusing the e-commerce giant of using data to gain an unfair advantage over merchants using its platform.
The EU's executive commission, the bloc's top antitrust enforcer, said Tuesday that the charges have been sent to the company.
The commission said it takes issue with Amazon's systematic use of non-public business data to avoid “the normal risks of competition and to leverage its dominance"" for e-commerce services in France and Germany, the company's two biggest markets in the EU.
The EU started looking into Amazon in 2018 and has been focusing on its dual role as a marketplace and retailer.

In addition to selling its own products, the U.S. company allows third-party retailers to sell their own goods through its site. Last year, more than half of the items sold on Amazon worldwide were from these outside merchants.
Amazon faces a possible fine of up to 10% of its annual worldwide revenue, which could amount to billions of dollars. The company rejected the accusations.
“We disagree with the preliminary assertions of the European Commission and will continue to make every effort to ensure it has an accurate understanding of the facts,” the company said in a statement.
The company can, under EU rules, reply to the charges in writing and present its case in an oral hearing.

Being burnt out after 15 years I did not intend to jump straight back into industry so decided instead to test an active vs passive investing strategy for a few years.

I was a die hard efficient market / boglehead, but always enjoyed the process of stock picking, and being a hubristic \*\*\*\* decided on 50% SPY and 50% for a stock picking retail account. My background is private equity and I am comfortable doing deep dive research, building DCF models etc etc.

50% went into SPY on 2nd Dec 2018 at 263. I did nothing to this account since. Dividends were auto-reinvested. 

In the active account, I built a portfolio of small and micro cap stocks focussing on sectors I know well. The portfolio held 14 stocks after 21 months. A few have been turned over since with new ones added but generally the approach has been to buy and hold good businesses. Dividends were auto-reinvested. I spent 15 hours a week on research and analysis, so about **1380 hours** since Dec 2018.

Since 3rd December 2018:

*SPY with dividends reinvested has returned 21.5% annualised.*

*The active portfolio has returned 25% annualised (incidentally with a higher sharpe ratio / lower max drawdown.* It has delivered in raw terms an additional $90,000 over the passive fund. Divide by 1380 hours = $65/hr. Worth it? Sure. If you enjoy something, and can do it ad-hoc from your own home, being paid $65/hr is a pretty good result, especially as that figure will compound over time, assuming continued results. I can share the portfolio and results on request.

Beating the market is quite addictive of course. A boglehead would say 2 years proves nothing with regards to luck vs skill and I would agree.

I'm a mechanical engineering student with a hobby interest in finance.  I've spent the last few days figuring out if Nikola's leasing model is actually possible.  There's some really wacky stuff going on in Nikola's presentations and financial projections, and I wanted to share my findings.

&#x200B;

This is an absolute wall of words, and I wouldn't be offended if you didn't want to read it all.  In the first half, I try to tease out the cost per mile of an actual Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) given the specification Nikola lists.   Next there is a portion where I look at the discrepancies between their Financial Projections and their Lease breakdown.   Then a quick little peanut gallery where I look at their unrealistic assumptions and the hypocrisy of their comparisons.  Finally, a more serious portion where I discuss the design, efficiency, and utility implications of Nikola's chosen power output and battery capacity.  Hope you guys enjoy!

&#x200B;

Let's get started:

Nikola claims that they have the industry first holistic leasing program, including maintenance, fuel, and use of the vehicle. They plan on leasing for $.95 per mile @ 30% margin.  This implies an expense of ~~$.73~~ $.67 per mile to Nikola.

**Hydrogen costs:**

According to the DoE, it currently costs $5.10/kg to produce, compress, and dispense hydrogen.  Nikola claims they can do this for $2.47/kg.  I highly doubt their estimate, and will elaborate on that later.  Hydrogen has a specific energy 33.3 kWh/kg.  A Fuel cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) has an average thermal efficiency of 55%.  A diesel semi tractor, which easily compares to Nikola’s offerings, consumes about 1.25 kWh of work per km (or 2.125 per mile) of useful work loaded.

This implies the Nikola truck will use 3.86 kWh of hydrogen per mile, at a cost of $0.59 per mile, or $.29 using their estimates.  The DoE estimate could be pretty rosy as well, Hindenburg cited a practical price of $16 per kg for hydrogen in their report.  Nikola’s estimate in the leasing breakdown is 7.5 miles per kg of hydrogen @ $2.47 per kg.  That works out to $.33/mile.  Our estimates are pretty close, excluding hydrogen costs.  It looks like, in a surprising twist, they actually overestimated the energy consumption of a tractor.  Or maybe not.  We’ll get to that

ICCT Tractor-Trailer Fuel Consumption:  [https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/EU\_HDV\_Testing\_BriefingPaper\_20180515a.pdf](https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/EU_HDV_Testing_BriefingPaper_20180515a.pdf)

Why do I doubt their hydrogen cost estimates?  $2.5 per kg implies $.075 per kWh of hydrogen produced  The average price for Industrial electricity in Arizona, the state they are headquartered in, was $.068/kWh, some of the cheapest in the US.  Of course, there isn’t a 1:1 conversion of electricity to hydrogen: an electrolyzer uses about 50 kWh per kg of hydrogen ( specific energy of 33.3kWh/kg), making the electricity expense alone in excess of $.10 per kWh of hydrogen.  Electricity must also be used to compress the hydrogen.  This would take another \~4 kWh, though we’re already over budget.  God forbid they use California electricity at an average cost of $.15 per kWh.  The electricity expense for the Electrolyzers alone exceeds their estimates, much less depreciation expense, cost of capital, maintenance expense, salary expense, etc.  Clearly a bogus number.

I suppose they can use renewable excess during off-hours for cheap, but the rapidly decreasing costs of energy storage will likely level out those low prices rather quickly.  This also only works in Arizona and a select few other states; California not included.  There is the issue of a startup paying to build huge electrolyzers that might have a utilization factor of \~30%, and additional high pressure storage will be needed.  The abhorrent upfront capex needed to try and drive down operating costs is not viable for them.

NREL H2 cost analysis from 2011.  This is just about the most recent research I can find.  The abject lack of new material tells me it’s not exactly a hoppin’ field:  [https://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/production-cost-analysis.html#fn3](https://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/production-cost-analysis.html#fn3)

**Fuel Cell costs:**

Part of the reason there are currently so few FCVs on the road today is the limited service life of a fuel cell.  Fuel cells are precision manufactured components that degrade quickly when jostled & vibrated too violently.  This is not good when combined with the rock-hard suspensions of semi tractors.

The DoE targets a useful life of 150,000 miles for a fuel cell.  Currently, there is no information confirming this target has been met.  A Toyota Murai comes with a 100,000 mile warranty on its FC.  For the sake of argument, I will assume Nikola FCs can meet this target.  The DoE targets a cost of $40/kW for fuel cell production in 2020, provided mass hits 500,000.  This hasn’t happened yet, but I will again assume this to give Nikola the best chance.  As an aside:  Nikola’s decision to use exclusively GM FC technology in their Badger pickup indicates to me they have nothing “up their sleeve” to make the technology more viable, despite my optimistic assumptions.

I’ll assume the Nikola Two’s Fuel cell is 500 kW, less than the 750 kW claimed output.  I think it  likely their horsepower claim will be a peak power figure only achievable when the motors draw on the battery & FC.  I cannot confirm this, because Nikola does not list the output of their motors and FC separately (along with myriad other questionable, or lack of, claims).  I think this is reasonable, considering FC thermal efficiency is maximized between 20% and 30% load, and a semi will average \~90 kW of useful work required on the highway, translating to \~170 kW of FC usage.  This is near the peak efficiency band of a PEMFC.  This assumption also allows steady-state operation at 66% of the “rated” output.  This implies an upfront cost of $20,000.  A targeted useful life of 150,000 miles implies a depreciation expense of $.13 per mile.

NREL Stack Durability and Performance vs load chart:  [https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy19osti/73011.pdf](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy19osti/73011.pdf)

**Battery costs:**

Using BNEF 2023 battery cost estimates of $100/kWh, that equates to $25,000 of battery expense.  Assuming a useful life of .25M miles, more than any existing warranty currently covers, that results in a depreciation expense of $.125 per mile.

**Chassis and the rest:**

Lastly, I extrapolated an FCEV COGS of $175,000 per truck from their Financial projections, minus the $45,000 of equipment already listed, and a 15% scrap value I pulled out of my ass to try and help nikola here, leaves $104,000 depreciated over 700k miles, or a $.15 depreciation expense per mile.

**Maintenance costs:**

Nikola assumed a $.061/mile maintenance cost.  Any engineer should be able to see such a claim and immediately question it.  Tires alone should account for $.03 per mile.  That leaves…. $.031 for brakes, air lines, HVAC, wiring, electrical equipment, motors, inverters, those battery and FC expenses I already calculated, sensors, etc.  They make no additional provisions for the battery/FC in their leasing breakdown.  Pure, unadulterated bullshit.   The ICCT puts BEV per mile maintenance at \~$.19/mile.  How they squeezed 70% of those costs out, as an unproven startup, by going for a more complex FC-BEV hybrid is beyond me.

Nikola Leasing cost breakdown, p19:  [https://d32st474bx6q5f.cloudfront.net/nikolamotor/uploads/investor/presentation/presentation\_file/5/NikolaInvestorRoadShowPresentation042720.pdf](https://d32st474bx6q5f.cloudfront.net/nikolamotor/uploads/investor/presentation/presentation_file/5/NikolaInvestorRoadShowPresentation042720.pdf)

**Leasing Conclusions:**

Adding their laughably low per mile maintenance expense of .061 + .15 + .125 + .13 +.59  gives us an aggregate $1.06 per mile expense for Nikola.  Using their fuel expense estimate of $.29, this equates to $.76; still more than their projected gross expenses.  The first estimate is 50% over they need for their claimed 30% gross margin at $.95 per mile.  Note:  I used a projected battery expense, projected FC service life target, and projected FC production expense.  None of these have been met.  I used the average resitive forces acting on a US tractor-trailer, which appear to be lower than the number Nikola uses.  I did not include warranty expenses in my estimate.  Additionally, these are EXPENSES, and includes 0 profit for the suppliers of these parts.  The GM-Nikola deal clearly shows there will be little vertical integration in their production, and such allowances would have to be made.

A more reasonable estimate, including a still optimistic 3% interest expense for truck capex, a .4% annual warranty expense (corresponding to their presented 3% estimated reserve).  That reserve, btw, is very optimistic:  Tesla used a higher reserve on the S for years, while building a simpler product with a warranty length/distance a literal order of magnitude lower than the Nikola truck.  A \*STILL\* low maintenance expense of $.12, and a 10% margin for battery & FC production, we end up with an **$.92** per mile expense, or more than Nikola can afford, even when using their untenable $2.5 per kg hydrogen estimate.  This is before G&A expenses.  Their leasing business model is not possible.

**Lease Projections v. Income Projections:  Internal Chaos or Outright Fraud?**

It’s possible some of the folks at Nikola have already found those problems out, though.  Nikola says they have plans to Lease their trucks.  They’ve had presentation slides including the idea, and their truck descriptions on their website include a leasing plan.  In their most recent presentation at the DB Global Auto Industry Conference in June, however, the Leasing cost breakdown slide was conspicuously missing.  Their Financial projections slide showed 2,000 FCEV trucks being produced in 2023, and 470 million in revenue from FCEV sales.  This represents $235,000 per truck, and their FCEV revenue scales exactly linearly into their 2024 projected sales; no room for residual from the 2023 trucks.  **They’re projecting to sell them!**  Revenue from maintenance and Hydrogen sales are also listed separately.  Their Financial projections clearly show the upfront sale of trucks with additional Hydrogen fueling and maintenance revenue, and the leasing model slide has disappeared.  It’s easy to see why.  Their projected combined expenses and capex exceeds $7.5 billion through 2024, significantly more than their current $1 Billion in assets and a couple of lease payments would allow for.  This would take some intense share dilution (not something I think Trevor would be on board with) or extremely expensive leverage.

It’s not like they’re going to get cheap loans secured against their proprietary trucks, requiring their proprietary stations, to run only their customers’ preset routes.  A bank wouldn’t want that kind of collateral.  The leasing idea is a real mess.

Nikla DB presentation, projections are 2nd to last page:  [https://d32st474bx6q5f.cloudfront.net/nikolamotor/uploads/investor/presentation/presentation\_file/7/Nikola\_and\_VectoIQ\_Conference\_Presentation\_DB\_Global\_Auto\_Conference\_\_6.10.2020\_.pdf](https://d32st474bx6q5f.cloudfront.net/nikolamotor/uploads/investor/presentation/presentation_file/7/Nikola_and_VectoIQ_Conference_Presentation_DB_Global_Auto_Conference__6.10.2020_.pdf)

One can claim that the lease model is still in the description of the trucks, but so are battery and fuel cell specifications for the Nikola one.  The Nikola one was, ostensibly, never actually powered by hydrogen, and development has since been abandoned.  It looks like their leasing Idea may have been abandoned as well.

I’ll also point out that an expected 2024 FCEV maintenance revenue of 56 million on 7000 trucks sold, assuming an average of 50,000 miles per truck sold in 2024 (the average mileage if the trucks are sold at a constant rate through the FY) and 100,000 per truck in 2023, equates to 12.4 cents per mile, more than double the $.061 projected maintenance costs in the april lease presentation.  Either they plan on making a killing from maintenance, or there was some aggressive re-shuffling of numbers when maintenance went from an expense to revenue stream, or vice versa.

The same analysis of hydrogen expenses puts their per kg revenue at $4.08.  Still low, but a hefty sum above their $2.47 cost average on the leasing slide.

If we use their projected FCEV maintenance revenue of $.124, $4.08 per kg H2 revenue, and $235,000 truck price depreciated over 7 years w/no interest expense, **the cost of ownership, according to their income projections, is $1 per mile** for a 100,000 mile year.  **More than they say a diesel will cost**.  OOPS!

That’s most of what I wanted to talk about.  It’s pretty clear that Nikola cannot possibly make a profit with their lease model, and Nikola’s finance department has indirectly acknowledged this.  Hydrogen tech is still many, many years away.  Nikola’s move fast and break things approach (though I’m not convinced we’ve seen much moving outside of gravity assists) will end up a “move fast and bankrupt things” strategy.

&#x200B;

I now want to take a few moments to look at some of the sillier things I found in my research:

In a laughably exuberant turn of events, Nikola projects 25% gross margins during their first year of production.  That’s downright cute!  They plan on, ostensibly, slapping GM FCs & batteries on IVECO platforms, and beating the margins of all publicly traded auto companies sans Ferrari within a few months of production start.  It's that easy.  Get your shit together, Ford!

On Nikola’s website under their trucks, they have a comparison of FCs, BEVs, and Diesel where they seem to forget their trucks have hundreds of kWhs of battery storage onboard.  They claim “Hydrogen acts as a buffer and grid balance,” while “batteries are a drain on the grid.”  You heard it hear first, folks, batteries can’t be used as a grid buffer, only a grid drain.  They also claim H2 is the “most abundant element on the planet,” while “Batteries \[are\] made of non-renewable resources; dangerous/costly to mine.”  Makes me wonder why they chose to put so many on their trucks.  Also hilariously hypocritical, considering Platinum -required for PEMFCs- is one of the rarest metals on earth.

**Design considerations and odd choices:**

I want to take a moment to talk about chassis design and the implications of Nikola’s set power parameters.  And I want to start with a quote from Elon Musk during the Tesla Semi reveal:

“We designed the Tesla truck like a bullet,” Musk said. “A normal diesel truck is designed like a barn wall.” The Tesla Semi is more aerodynamic than a $2 million Bugatti Chiron sports car, he said.

A bold claim, but I believe this to be correct.  Cheesy, but correct.  Why?  Cooling requirements.  The more cooling air you need, the less favorable aerodynamics you’ll have.  In the simple representation of an engine, there is a fuel input, a work output, and a heat output.  A gas engine  -especially one not designed with fuel efficiency in mind like the Chiron’s- will likely only output \~20-25% of its fuel input as a work output.  The Chiron makes 1,500 hp, and needs to reject 4,500-6,000 hp of heat at full throttle.  The goal of a Chiron isn’t to slip through the air, au contraire.  It’s designed suck in as much air as possible for cooling and brute it’s way to 270 mph through raw horsepower.  Most modern sedans have more favorable aerodynamics than a Bugatti.

&#x200B;

On the other hand, about 90% of the inputs from an EV charger make it to the wheels -- a major factor that makes EVs so efficient.  This means Elon can put, for example, 1000 hp of motors in his truck and only worry about rejecting 100 hp of heat at full load, an easy task.  That’s less cooling than a Prius needs, and the truck can be designed with virtually zero air input constraints.  He can swing his “3x the acceleration” dick around, and the only tradeoff is beefier driveline bits for the extra torque and bigger motors.

C\_D lists on wikipedia:  Note almost every production car below Cd=.24 is either a small displacement diesel or electric.  No supercars in sight.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile\_drag\_coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_drag_coefficient)

The Chiron’s standard Cd is .38.  A 1995 ford windstar minivan has a standard Cd of .35.  Not exactly a prestigious club, haha:

[https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/car-technology/a32329/these-rare-development-photos-tell-the-full-bugatti-chiron-story/](https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/car-technology/a32329/these-rare-development-photos-tell-the-full-bugatti-chiron-story/)

Hydrogen is a different story.  The thermal efficiency of a FCEV -above 50% load- will dip down into the 40-50% range.  The average efficiency of a diesel truck is \~45%, and it will dip to \~35% at max rpm, full load.  ‘Ever seen the video where Trevor says the production trucks won’t need as much cooling as their current prototypes?  He’s lying through his teeth.  A 1000 hp FC would need more than 1000 hp of cooling; as much if not more than a 500hp diesel.  It's also important to note that less heat is lost in exhaust from a PEMFC, and lower operating temps mean that actual cooling airflow required is significantly more than an equivalent diesel would require.  500 hp diesels are already built like a brick with a front aftercooler & radiator the size of a football field.  Trevor’s dick swinging has major consequences.  More cooling means more drag, more weight in heat sinks/radiators, and more power draw to move coolant.  These all create positive feedback loops, e.g. more air requirements mean less favorable aerodynamics & more drag, which means more power draw at speed, which means more cooling, which means more air requirements...  It’s not all fun and games like the pure BEV Tesla is making.

&#x200B;

Daimler’s recently announced H2 semi offering only has 300 kW, and they can recycle their waste heat to warm up incoming liquid hydrogen, Nikola uses compressed hydrogen and won’t have the same luxury.  Running so much horsepower is a real head scratcher; one would think their head of R&D’s only experience was pouring concrete or something.

&#x200B;

It’s also important to note US tractor-trailers are hard capped at 80,000 lbs.  This means that every pound of tractor weight is a pound taken from potential cargo.  Y’know… the part that actually makes money.  One has to wonder why Nikola is keeping \~5000 lbs of batteries on the tractor; their website showed they aren’t fans of the stuff.  It’s enough to run a loaded tractor two full hours on battery alone, more than a regenerative braking system would require or power peaking during a hill climb.  It’s dumb; 100 kWh would be more than enough when an on-demand primemover like a hydrogen cell is also onboard.  It’s an expensive and opulent display to the vexation of customers, who would, in all likelihood, much prefer an extra 2 tons of cargo capacity.

Features like 1000 hp and 250 kWh of battery appeal more to retail investors than trucking companies.

&#x200B;

Actual conclusion time:  I think that I pretty conclusively showed that:

1. Nikola’s hydrogen cost projections are bogus.  There isn’t even enough money there to pay for the electrolysis and compression, much less maintenance, depreciation, or labor.
2. Nikola’s leasing costs undercutting diesel is bogus.  One can disprove that with their own financial projections, much less the real costs of FCs and H2 electrolysis.
3. Nikola’s plan to lease the trucks is totally divorced from reality, according to their own financial projections.
4. Nikola’s projected per mile operating & maintenance expenses are beyond indefensible.
5. A myriad of odd, marketing focused design choices limit the trucks on-road efficiency and utility to potential customers.

>  President Donald Trump is ""obsessed"" with Amazon, a source told the news website Axios, and is eyeing legal means to go after the online retail giant.

> According to the Axios reporter Jonathan Swan, Trump believes Amazon is a negative force for smaller, locally owned retailers and wants to find a way to curtail the company's dominance in online shopping. According to Axios' sources, he is considering a change to Amazon's tax status or a crackdown down through antitrust rules.

> The Supreme Court is already considering a case that could give states more power to collect sales tax on online retailers.

> While Amazon already imposes the applicable state sales tax on goods it sells, when a third-party seller uses the platform, it is up to that seller to collect sales tax. Many third-party sellers on Amazon do not collect those taxes.

> Trump hasn't been shy about his distaste for Amazon and its CEO, Jeff Bezos, previously tweeting that the retailer is hurting the US Postal Service and attacking Bezos for his ownership of The Washington Post.

> ""Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers,"" Trump tweeted in August. ""Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt - many jobs being lost!""

> Concern over Amazon's effect on the American retail landscape is widely held. But Trump's grumblings about the company's relationship with the US Postal Service seem unfounded, given that much of the USPS' financial woes come from funding mismanagement, pension obligations, and the non-package side of its business.

> According to Axios, Trump has also soured on Amazon in part because fellow real-estate developers have complained to Trump that the company is helping to kill off brick-and-mortar retailers and malls.

> Axios said the president did not have a clear plan to go after the company yet.

From what I'm understanding, the White House administration is willing to have swing states targeted by EU/Canada/Australia/Japan/China's trade retaliations (e.g. soybean import restrictions), or is completely unaware of what happened in 2002. I wouldn't be surprised if the EU pulls up their old 2002 tariff retaliation playbook and goes after the swing states again. The question is how the White House will respond?

EDIT: I also find it interesting that the White House does not trust steel imports from the EU/Canada/Australia/Japan, as they originally proposed the tariff as a ""national security"" measure. If they all turned against the US during a war (including NATO ignoring the US or disbanding), the US is screwed anyways.

EDIT2: This trade tariff was blamed for helping kick off the Great Depression. Once that passed, everyone enacted trade restrictions against each other until global trade effectively collapsed: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot%E2%80%93Hawley_Tariff_Act

I've stayed consistent with this belief the entire time, whether we go up or down. If you just wanted any more proof, take a look at the Twitter link, as an additional piece of evidence. It's the same case in the recent up moves (the futures are contributing to the majority of the recent up move). 

https://mobile.twitter.com/bespokeinvest/status/1248368169091239937

Retail, institutional investors, pension funds, etc. - they don't trade overnight futures. However you know who does? Stat arb algos as well as option trading firms/hedge funds/prop trading firms/bank risk-mitigation algos. For example if a hedge fund was put into a dicey risk situation, they turn on these algos to offload risk overnight. If they can't sell credit risk, they have to do it elsewhere like in ES futures. If an option market maker is short gamma and realizes oh crap, this is gonna cause me to be super long tomorrow with this move in ES, I've gotta hedge and turn on my overnight algo to sell first so I get less long deltas overnight. 

So when you guys want to ask ""who in the world is even selling"" as we sold off and now ""who in the world is even buying"" as we go up, it's the algos. You are right, not many actual people are buying these days. It's the algos, and when I say algos, I mean the risk/liquidity algos.

Do you want to know why the algos are buying now? It's simple. Jerome Powell said he's buying credit ETFs. If you are a market maker, you have to sell these ETFs to them. Now you have to find a beta hedge. What's the best way to find that beta hedge? Buy ES futures. This then causes SPY to open higher. Now, if your algo was fast enough, you could have front ran the FED by buying HYG and JNK (this is why their NAV is trading at a massive premium), but if you weren't, well you get desperate as you get picked off from being short credit, so now you have to buy ES, SPY, and anything else you can. You might have to then buy SPX/SPY puts with it since you then have to protect your now new ES/SPY longs (which you didn't actually want to buy but were ""forced"" to buy),, which is why VIX hasn't dropped that much relative to how much SPY has gone up. It's all an algorithmically driven market. 

This is why the entire market, on BOTH the down move and the now up move, has decoupled from the economy. So no, you guys may think people are FOMOing in. That's not true. Most investors aren't FOMOing in right now. The algos have just gone out of control on both the down and up moves and it's all technical. 

Correlation (with other assets like credit and bonds), positioning (short squeeze and forced liquidations), option gamma (short gamma makes moves bigger), and short term stat arb strategies dominate the market short term. Retail and even big firms like Blackrock or Berkshire do not. Fundamentals win out long term. It may be months for SPY, and it is years for individual companies. No short term movement is ever controlled for by actual people wanting to put on a position. 

As I said a month ago when we were selling off, if Citadel and Renaissance Technologies wanted to hold up the entire market for a day, they easily could. They may not want to if it's not in their favor, but they easily could. Two firms. That's enough. That about sums up this market. (EDIT: this part may have been extremely confusing due to my bad wording, but if you read some of the posts below with like me, MasterCookSwag, and ArseneWankerer, I try to clear up my meaning)

Another interesting and true fact? If options trading was ELIMINATED, the market would NEVER have sold off to 220 and it would have never skyrocketed back to almost 280 now. You may ask it's the same fundamentals right? Yes it is, the fundamentals of the economy and virus are the same, but elimiate options, and actually the entire market changes.

Finally, to add one more thing, if this wasn't clear, there needs to be a catalyst for the first wave of selling and buying, but everything after that is purely technical. For example, the catalysts would have been the virus and the oil shock in the wave of selling. The catalyst would have been the Fed in the wave of buying. However, the catalyst in itself shouldn't have produced a very large move. For example, imagine we go from 290 -> 270 as an example. The catalyst, if only traded by itself, should have moved it from 290 -> 285. However, the algos, with all the technical details I described above, then moves it from 285 -> 270. This is what I call ""forced selling"" or ""fake selling,"" and I've alluded to this in my other posts. There is also ""fake buying"" in the reverse. However, ""fake selling"" is usually more powerful because on average people leverage up to be more bullish than bearish in an average market environment. So yes, the initial catalyst is important, but it's not the reason for the majority of short term moves. 

I worked in the industry so I know this. You can call it a dirty secret, but hopefully if you see some actual statistics (see the above link on Twitter), you'll understand too. Fundamentals eventually will win longer term, but you know that saying about how the market can stay irrational before you stay solvent, well that's literally true because the market is algo driven. And as we progress into a state of better technology and even more options volume (think about how many people just recently started trading options) and other assets, this will be more and more true. One of these days, which could be like in 20+ years,  if some black swan catalyst happens in conjunction with all of these technical factors I mentioned, you literally can see a 20% triple circuit breaker day immediately and like 90%+ of that drop would be all technical.

I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability.

EDIT: So for the people who are pointing out I don't understand what a MM is, let's do a easier example with NFL betting lines. Vegas acts like a MM in this regard.  When an NFL line closes, is it 50/50 on both sides of the line?  Nope.  Vegas is still subject to risk.  That's why sometimes they win or lose a lot of money depending on the outcome of an event, even though they are a ""MM"" too.  Yes, Vegas will adjust a line based on some order flow, but it has their OWN MODELS TOO to determine what is fair, so they will adjust accordingly to the toxicity of the order flow. They will not just completely change their line so much so simply based pure order flow to keep on capturing 50/50.  If you really think an options MM for example goes home every night flat every Greek, you are kidding yourself.  

The point I was making above is a firm such as Citadel does so much volume that they have a huge impact on the market, whereas if you take them out of the market for say a month, the entire market microstructure changes in options and equities.  Notice in my original post, I clearly said that these firms may not actually want to do this in their favor, but I am using them as an example saying they do so much volume they can IF they wanted to (in options you are more likely to do so than equities). I was emphasizing this point to show you guys how algos play such a large role in the market. It's similar to Vegas when they act as a MM to betting lines.  They control the betting line at the end of the day.  They aren't always 50/50 on both sides with no risk.  Of course, Citadel and SIG in options will adjust their vol curves based on some order flow, but at the end of the day, they control most of the options vol pricing, which indirectly also affects equities in a big way when we have massive short gamma moves.

Similarily, apply it to sports betting.  Let's say we shut down Vegas for a month and let only DraftKings price all the betting lines.  I bet you the lines would be different and the volume would be different.  Would they be completely different (like a -3 to a +3 line)?  No, it wouldn't be that extreme, but it would be different and volume would be different and reaction to order flow would be different. Just think about it like this and apply it to trading.

EDIT2: this was also my post like ~3 weeks ago when we were like ~230.  Too bad r/investing deleted my context of my post (since it relates to a lot of what I said below), but you can still see my title and my comments, so you know what I was calling.

Addressing the above link, it's the type of logic that I am using in my below posts to probabilistically call bottoms like this.  I'm never 100% sure (it's impossible to even be like 70%+ sure imo), but if you put some of this together (like when does the forced selling for the risk/liquidty algos stop?), you can actually call bottoms a bit easier than just winging it 50/50.  Notice that this also coincided with March options expirations, as I mention, options are a big part.  It also conincided with Jay Powell saying he's going to ""alleviate the risks"" (this is the forced selling from algos risk) he sees in the repo and now credit market.

EDIT4: ok last edit but https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pinningthestrike.asp is just a quick example of one phenomenon that happens due to options and market makers.  There's not going to be many articles you can find online on about what I'm talking about, but this pinning the strike phenomenon is a well-observed effect that's actually writen about of what market makers can do in terms of controlling price action due to their risk.  Interestingly, what we have in our case the last month is the opposite of this in which rather than strikes getting pinned, strikes get blown through to cause the huge moves (since we've been in short gamma the last month).  The article isn't super detailed, but can give you a general idea of one effect.

EDIT5: sorry I'll add one last edit...I do realize maybe my wording was not the greatest in my post, and after reading it again, it does sound a bit ""forceful"" at times, so I apologize for that.  This was meant to be more informative, but please don't take it as I am trying to force any one opinion on anyone.  Apologize for that!",2020-04-12 03:35:51

865,Berkshire Hathaway and the incredible power of float,1101,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ijnr09/berkshire_hathaway_and_the_incredible_power_of/,102,"  

Today we’re going to talk about float, what it is and how you can build billion-dollar companies with it. Float is the money that a business receives today but doesn’t have to pay out until sometime in the future. Float is most commonly seen in insurance companies with customers paying premiums upfront to insure themselves against bad things happening sometime in the future. More examples include: Video game publishers, where they receive pre-orders. Commercial banking when they receive deposits and so on. 

Why is receiving money upfront so valuable even when it needs to be paid at later date? Well, you can invest it! And the longer you have to invest it, the more likely it will grow larger than the amount that you will have to eventually pay out! So, you can see how easily this can snowball. Say I owned a tiny insurance business that insured $1,000 worth of damages for a year in exchange for a $100 upfront payment. If I have $10,000 in the bank I can safely have say, five customers insured like this every year for $500. Every year I can invest the money I got from those new customers and every year the cash I have grows so I can safely insure more customers and the cash you have grows in an exponential manner. Ok cool got it. So, what does this have to do with Berkshire Hathaway?

Sometime around the mid-1960s Mr. Buffett realized, with the help of his friend Charlie Munger, that he can’t keep investing in broken down businesses and had to instead look for “franchise” business that will continue to compound his hard earned capital through thick and thin. The next thing he realized is that he couldn’t just rely on the free cash flow generated from those company’s and had to instead find low cost financing for his acquisitions. That low cost financing came in the form of an insurance float which, as we’ve seen, are the premiums paid by insurance customers up front in order to be paid out by the insurance company later. Buffett bought a ton of these insurance companies starting with National Indemnity in 1967

Wait, why did we just say that float is low cost financing? Why is it financing and what is the cost of that financing? Well, float is financing because you are receiving money today, but you have to pay it out sometime in the future, exactly like a loan. The beauty of float though is that you don’t have to pay interest on that money! The only “interest” that you have to pay on that money is the normal cost of operating your business.

We’ve already seen why float would matter so much to Buffett, but it bears repeating.  A dollar you receive today is worth more than a dollar you get a week from now because you can invest it at some rate to receive more money in the future. Buffet realized that the more float he had, the more float he could invest to buy other businesses. Float would compound in lockstep with the free-cashflow generated by his other businesses and in time create a juggernaut.

The final step in the Berkshire secret formula was increasing the duration of time between when the premiums are received and when they’re paid out. So, for Buffett, this meant buying up longer tailed insurance companies like insurance for catastrophes, and recently, Reinsurance companies.  And there you have it! This is the basic DNA of one the most successful stocks in over the past 50 years and they’re still going at it.",2020-08-31 11:13:58

I guess it's going well.

2020 has been a strangely good year for companies in the real estate business with demand for homes in many cities jumping.

In June, homes were sold at their fastest pace since [2018](https://www.zillow.com/research/active-to-pending-fastest-pace-27382/).

Now, Zillow is further monetizing their rental marketplace by making landlords in certain markets pay [$40/mo to list vacancies](https://twitter.com/AyeshaSelden/status/1278817946882789379).

If they don't completely drive away landlords with this move, it looks like a smart way to improve margins at a time when landlords are struggling to find tenants and prospective shoppers are doing almost all of their shopping online.

Crude oil advanced and yields on Treasuries rose.

The S&P 500 jumped 3.2% after Moderna Inc. said its vaccine tests yielded signs it can create an immune-system response in the body. Companies that would benefit from a return toward more normal economic activity rallied. Carnival Corp. surged 15%, while Delta Air Lines and Live Nation Entertainment climbed more than 13%. Energy producers popped 7.5% and real-estate firms added almost 5%.

The risk-on rally comes as more economies around the world and within the U.S. ease restrictions that created one of the steepest downturns since the Depression. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressed the central bank has more ammunition to combat weakness. The Stoxx Europe 600 jumped the most since March, while indexes in Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea all posted modest advances.

“Powell addressing that the Fed is not out of ammo combined with positive vaccine trial data has set the markets off to the races,” said Matt Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. “It just shows that sentiment can change so quickly in times like these.”

Gold traded at its highest price in seven years before retreating, while West Texas oil rose above $30 a barrel for the first time in two months as producers in the U.S. and elsewhere continued to cut activity.

While Powell said the U.S. economy’s recovery could stretch to the end of 2021, he added that policy makers are “not out of ammunition by a long shot.” Several European countries ended bans on short selling, as they continued to report the lowest number of daily deaths from the virus since March.

“The market is very tied to measuring the success of these economic reopenings,” said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist for Charles Schwab & Co. “A successful vaccine would really make those reopenings very successful. The market is excited about that news although it would be a long time until the vaccine is developed.”

I wanted to put it out there and see if anyone feels the same. Hopefully others are willing to contribute knowledge and observations about this very anomalous event)

I realize that this journal entry got a bit lengthy, so I chopped it into three parts, plus a very hand-wavy speculative conclusion part.

----     
The Pump  
-----     

Mid-January 2020, articles begin pumping TSLA as Musk announces share purchases.    
    
_Markets Insider -  Tesla short sellers have lost nearly $12 billion in just 7 weeks_     
     
_Markets Insider - Tesla has yet another biggest bull on Wall Street. Here's why he thinks the stock could surge 57%._    
     
_Electrek - Tesla (TSLA) gets new $800 price target based on its ability to execute_        
     
Musk is no stranger to stock pumping. Last year he advertised a private share price of 420$, ""funding secured"", to draw in investors. It is not surprising that this time the company (or another party) has turned to media outlets to get article placement from a third party. It is frowned-upon, but not uncommon, for companies to pay journalists, through brokers, to place articles in major publications.   

At the same time, mid-January, coordinated social media and message board posts appeared hyping TSLA and urging users to buy stock. Social media posts appeared on reddit, twitter, facebook about the price of Tesla on trajectory for $1000/share. Many influential users were caught in the frenzy and spread the word. A reddit and twitter user named /u/WSBgod began buying calls in TSLA at $600+; posting his positions and urging his large follower base to do the same. Many of these social media posts were well-written, edgy and bear the hallmarks of professional  copywriters.    

----    
The Dump    
----   
Tesla price began to rise. Viral social media posts and positive articles created high demand for TSLA stock, driving retail investors into a frenzy. On some message boards, users were seen urging people to take credit card advances or student loans to buy Tesla stock at $600+.   

At this point, a short-term ""spike"" in Teslas price occured. For the purposes of discussion, we will consider $767 (the stock issue price, discussed below) at market close to be the defining price of the spike.   

This spike began on 02/03 and ended on 02/26. The stock market was open 18 days  during this window. More remarkably, the closing price of TSLA was only above $767 per share on *12 days* during the window.   
**Chart of the 767$ price line and the recent spike**:   
https://gfycat.com/quaintslimyeuropeanpolecat   

It turns out this short stock market spike was no surprise to Tesla. Tesla and Goldman Sachs were already preparing to issue stock during this narrow period. Tesla filed an 8-K on 02/19 to issue  2.65 million new shares at $767 per share. Teslas/Goldman's  ""luck"" allowed them to issue on one of the top ten highest dates in TSLA history.    

Social media and message board influencers sold dreams of $1500 ""moon"" prices to middle-class retail investors. Many of his new investors were young; drawn by the new mobile-based, zero-commision brokers such as Robinhood. These younger investors typically turn to social media for their stock research. 

Many new and inexperienced investors are unfamiliar with stock ""dilution"" (the concept that issuing new stock devalues existing shareholders). Some shareholders even took to message boards to praise Tesla/Goldman for issuing more shares. Tesla raked in $2.31 billion of that cash advance, student loan, and summer job money during this short period of time, by issuing new shares at the $767 price.    

While the stock issue was happening, insiders began exercising options and dumping their stock. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with insiders selling stock. However  they were *very lucky* that this period happened mid-February - directly in-between earnings calls. This is one of the few timeframes outside of their blackout dates (blackout dates tend to cover most dates in the year for executives, particularly around earnings).

Five insiders can be seen exercising (buying) options and dumping stock during the narrow 18-day February spike time frame. Amidst the insider sales there is only one insider purchase - a well-publicized stock purchase by Elon Musk himself.     

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TSLA/insider-trades/    

----     
The wreckage settles     
----     

After the dump finished, the retail investor money was safely in the hands of insiders and Teslas cash reserves. Nameless large traders (known as ""whales"") began dumping the shares in high-volume batches, reaping the final harvest of the inflated stock price. Coincidentally, Covid-19 caused a general decrease in stock prices on the NYSE. The stock price plummeted. TSLA is now hovering around ~$400/share on 03/18, less than half the price of the all-time high where retail investors were paying upwards of $800-900 per share.    

Tesla is now $2.31 billion richer (although Tesla's high cash burn rate will incinerate this money within two quarters). Insiders at Tesla have gained hundreds of millions from their timely exit.    

On twitter and message boards, many users are depressed and downtrodden. The investment they purchased during the flurry of hype has lost its value. Many of the users who bought TSLA now joke about suicide or selling their house. Many users who got caught in the Tesla hype are silent - ashamed of their losses. Many are selling their devalued shares at a huge loss and will not return to invest in stocks for the time being.      

-----   
The other kind of speculation   
----    
Stock frenzys are not a new phenomenon. We can blame the media for the unrealistic moonshot expectations towards TSLA during the hype period.     
    
Yet, it is tough not to look at the timing of the entire event and squint:    
* The company orchestrated one of its largest stock issues during a very narrow 12 day market peak window -  a masterstroke in perfect timing and preparation     
* The media blitz ""pump"" occurred despite Teslas high debt load and extremely low car production rate (400k/year).     
* Institutional investors stayed put and let retail investors run in to the slaughter, chasing promises of $1000+ TSLA    
* Tesla insiders dumped their stock during this period       
    
Sadly, the SEC has been in a deep slumber for the past two decades. With the tech industry oligopolies running amok; plus thousands of pump-and-dumps that could only be orchestrated in a now socially-interconnected world, we need their enforcement now more than ever.     
    
Maybe there is some mythical horn we have to blow to rouse the SEC from its slumber. Until then, we can only look at incidents like this and squint at the happenstance. I hope that people far smarter and better researched than myself will look into the Tesla spike and verify that everything is above-board.    
     
""Funding secured""

-----
Edit: Counterpoints
-----

There are a few aspects of this situation that go against my hypothesis that the price was pumped.

* The dump occurred during the Covid-19 outbreak. It is difficult to seperate market manipulation from the general downturn during this period   
* Tesla insiders still hold a large portion of TSLA stock   
* Musk himself purchased stock during the spike. (This is a good point, although I don't believe the stock purchase represents a major buy, considering Musk's enormous wealth. Teslas survival is a point of personal pride to Musk. He has been known to play dirty when his reputation is threatened - he once hired a private investigator to dig up dirt on a dive instructor from Thailand that snubbed him)
* The price rose due to the short squeeze. (This is a counterargument I generally disagree with. The short interest was orders of magnitude smaller than the purchase volume that drove the price to $900+)",2020-03-18 17:06:13

The following is an opinion piece posted on **Bloomberg** yesterday. The author, John Authers, essentially make an argument for investors to simply do nothing. 

>Extreme situations create opportunities; they also offer the chance to  lose ungodly sums of money. That is why we need to be careful with what  psychologists call activity bias. It is a natural emotion, [as I have written before](https://www.ft.com/content/7a4c06c4-dbc8-11dc-bc82-0000779fd2ac), and doing nothing requires great self-discipline. But it is often what the situation calls for.

He calls for investors to stop attempting to buy the dip by referring to a [famous op-ed that Warren Buffett wrote for the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/opinion/17buffett.html?dbk) during the financial crash urging people to buy more. 

Later on, he cites John C. Bogle's advice on what do during times of volatility in the markets:

>*“My rule — and it’s good only about 99% of the time, so I have to be  careful here — when these crises come along, the best rule you can  possible follow is not “Don’t stand there, do something,” but “Don’t do  something, stand there!”*

Although I don't necessarily agree the conclusions, as someone who has been adding to their portfolio during this market freefall, it made me ponder if I should just stop looking at my investing app for opportunity.",2020-03-19 00:03:31

884,Lessons from the Japanese asset bubble in the 80s,1081,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ic1rlt/lessons_from_the_japanese_asset_bubble_in_the_80s/,432,"For those unfamiliar, the Japanese stock and property markets by 1989 had run up to absurd valuations (the Nikkei 225 hit a Shiller CAPE of 80) and then collapsed, never to recover. I used to think this massive bubble proved you can’t just buy and hold ignoring all fundamentals and valuations, but recently came across this: https://ritholtz.com/2017/10/japan-greatest-bubble-time/

Key takeaways:

> Never underestimate how far people can take the markets to the extremes. This works in both directions. The pendulum swings back and forth but always seems to go further than most would assume is possible. 

> **Valuations don’t work as a timing tool. If you tried to use them in Japan you probably would have gotten out of the market a decade before the peak.** It’s easy to say this in hindsight, but there were few scenarios where the late-1980s real estate and stock market valuations could have been validated going forward.

> Diversification, as always, is the key to avoiding a blow-up. The entire point of diversification is to avoid having your entire portfolio in a Japan situation. The global stock market has done just fine since 1990 **even when you include Japan in the results.**

Other assets you might’ve deiversified into that would’ve saved you: Japanese government bonds, Japanese small cap and value stocks (the Nikkei 225, as name suggests, only has mega caps), and foreign real estate.",2020-08-19 01:14:38

""The U.S. Labor Department’s weekly jobless claims report has yet to reflect at least half a million filings for a federal pandemic program, with data reporting lagging behind payouts.

Florida, Alabama, Arizona, Hawaii and West Virginia are among 18 states that showed zero initial claims under pandemic unemployment assistance, or PUA, in the Labor Department’s weekly report last Thursday. But the same states have actually received at least half a million in combined claims through the program -- established by the CARES Act -- which is aimed at helping those typically not eligible for regular state benefits, including the self-employed and gig workers.

The gulf between the Labor Department’s data and state numbers -- compiled by Bloomberg News through state press releases, comments by officials and related data -- indicates the labor-market hit from the coronavirus may be more widespread than thought. While it doesn’t significantly alter the overall picture of mass unemployment as tens of millions of Americans have filed for benefits since mid-March, the undercounting further complicates closely watched data already beset by other errors and distortions.""",2020-06-05 00:14:08

Until recently investors assumed that Tariff Man would keep the trade talks in his back pocket, eventually striking a deal for an easy win before re-election.

What many are now realizing, is that China may not come back to the table, or at least in the same manner that they had before. China’s Communist Party has pressure from their hardline nationalists to walk away. President Xi Jinping has created a political brand centered around more nationalistic policy that is critical of the “Opening of China” to Western markets. The politically safe move for Xi Jinping is to stand up to the US to prove China’s strength and independence, regardless of the economic ramifications.

Another factor sinking in for investors is the prospect of supply chain disruptions which will take years to re-establish. As Tariff Man has proved his unpredictability with the addition of recent Mexico tariffs, companies cannot rely on stable trade policy to simply move their production from China to Mexico. There is an increased risk involved with relying on Tariff Man’s current trade policy to establish new supply chains, since they could be disrupted tomorrow with a simple tweet. Companies looking to establish new factories and supply chains may be inclined to wait until the end of Tariff Man’s reign to find some stability before re-establishing or expanding their production.",2019-06-03 04:22:56

896,The coronavirus is vastly under appreciated,1070,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fexlqx/the_coronavirus_is_vastly_under_appreciated/,488,"I believe this is the largest black swan event anyone alive has seen. It will have dramatic health and market/financial consequences that are vastly undervalued. Below is my rationale for that thesis. 

1. In 2009 H1N1 infected 1/5 of the world population (crazy, right?) due to its airborne transmission characteristic but ended up having a very low mortality rate of 0.02% as humanity’s general influenza antibodies proved very effective. 

2. COVID19 spreads more effectively than H1N1 through airborne transmission (this is a disputed fact/assumption; https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-disease-2019-vs-the-flu) and 2x incubation period. Unlike H1N1 influenza, people have no have antibody defense for this strain of coronavirus - hence the novel nomenclature. The purported 1-4% death rate would be the most deadly virus to spread in the last 100 years and tens of millions of people could die. 

3. The virus is insidiously effective because it A) Does not cause large complications/illness in most people so they go about their life and spread continues; B) in the portion of the population it does seriously affect - it is serious serious, with numbers indicating 10ish% of infections require hospitalization and ventilator support. There is no healthcare system on the planet that can accommodate this, the system will get overwhelmed. 

4. The social distancing protocol that China put in place is almost unfathomable. 1.5 billion people have largely not left their apartment in 6 weeks other than to buy food periodically. This is why new numbers are declining but based on 1 and 2 this is just temporary and the virus will inevitably spread again. The virus is incapable of being “contained”. Extreme social distancing a la China might buy time until the 12 month lead time for a vaccine arrives but this would decimate economies. 

5. China style social distancing is impossible outside of China and smaller dictatorships but governments will impose and people will begin self imposing smaller versions. Expect to see March Madness, Coachella, etc all canceled and any business that is able move to work from home. 

6. The economy at the end of the day is driven by end consumer consumption of goods and services, often provided by small mom and pop businesses. Those speaking of a v shaped recovery are non sensical. A drastic month to multi-month drop in cash flow will tip over many of businesses and they will not meet obligations such as payroll. Your neighborhood burger joint can’t fall back on its strong balance sheet and wait for the V/U.

7. 6 will lead to recession and a domino effect through the economy. Where 08 was a top down driven recession this one will be bottom up. It being bottoms up also means it more resistant to the few monetary policy tools we have come accustomed to using. There will be a complete shakeout in the economy as we psychologically grapple with what this virus is going to mean and what things will look like when it is over. Once people start to understand that people they know will die things will get even more panicky. 

8. The world will recover and economies bounce back but we are in for a ride that has largely only been text book theoretical before this. Buckle up.",2020-03-08 03:41:15

I've copy/pasted because I know most of y'all don't have Bloomberg subscriptions.  

> **Traders putting on the short squeeze aren’t motivated by greed. They’re engaged in an anger-driven uprising against the establishment.**

>**Anger Is an Energy**


>The saga of GameStop Corp. continues. By the end of another frenetic day of trading Tuesday, the stock had just topped its high from Monday. Between those peaks, it staged a fall of more than 50% on Monday afternoon. Colleagues have followed these extraordinary developments as they happened. I will try for now simply to process the single most important question: Is this just a weird technical situation, of the kind that comes along every few years, that can otherwise be safely ignored? Or does it tell us something important about market conditions as a whole?

>GameStop's share price surged back to set a new high
Purely qualitatively, based on what I have witnessed, I think it does matter. The signal it sends is disquieting, if not surprising. It also introduces us to a new variant on an ancient market phenomenon.

>The cliche is that market capitalism works on the balance between greed and fear.  The standard defense is as follows: If the greed to make money by beating the competition is matched by a fear of failure through making too many mistakes or cutting corners, then capitalism works. Nothing else yet discovered gives people such an incentive to work and create growth. Speculative bubbles happen when greed becomes excessive, or when fear diminishes too much. Easy money and easier trading with derivatives oil these emotions and allow them to run riot. The financial crisis of 2008 happened in large part because years of policy had convinced investors that there would be a bailout if they failed; they lost their fear, and greed took over. 


>This feeds into the debate over whether we have a speculative bubble at present. Markets are pervaded by gloom and worry, so there is no lack of fear — even if confidence that interest rates will never rise is growing excessive. Meanwhile, there is little in the way of greed. Cryptocurrency has generated excitement, as has Tesla Inc., but in the main the frenzy over a historic opportunity to get rich, of the kind that was everywhere in 1999, is lacking. This is a different, worried world. The last two decades have stripped it of its positivity. The mood is nothing like the great bubbles of the past.

>Instead of greed, this latest bout of speculation, and especially the extraordinary excitement at GameStop, has a different emotional driver: anger. The people investing today are driven by righteous anger, about generational injustice, about what they see as the corruption and unfairness of the way banks were bailed out in 2008 without having to pay legal penalties later, and about lacerating poverty and inequality. This makes it unlike any of the speculative rallies and crashes that have preceded it. 

>On Monday, I argued that it was misplaced to take pleasure at the pain for the short-sellers who had attacked GameStop stock, and then been subjected to a “short squeeze” for the ages by traders coordinating on Reddit. I received a bumper crop of feedback. Here are some representative samples (leaving out many with unprintable expletives):

>>“You kind of miss the point of what is going on with GameStop. How much did Melvin pay you to write this garbage? shill. Literally trying to protect an industry trying to fleece jobs from low income workers. Sleep well chump.” 

>>“Watching entitled institutional shorts whine on TV and OP EDs that millennials equipped with margin accounts & zero fees are collaborating on Reddit to target them is my new favorite sport. Looks perfectly healthy from where I'm sitting, which is on bull side :) plus 1 for the little guys.”

>>“Normal isn't putting the retail trader down for being independent while organized hedge funds force you to take their way or suffer in fear. Normal is the American dream and being able to make your own way. This isn't a casino. This is a riot.”

>One respondent warned that the people squeezing the shorts aren’t “a herd of impressionable youngsters with Robinhood accounts. No. They are an experienced & ruthless army of insomniacs followed by a silent legion of rapidly learning new traders. This is a new paradigm that won’t go away.”

>Another told me I was a “dumb boomer” amid a screed of unprintable epithets. (Point of information: I’m just too young to be a boomer. I’m in Generation X, but it’s the intergenerational antagonism that’s noteworthy.) Another said that the short squeeze was just a way for millennials to recoup the money they had been forced to pay to bankers during the TARP rescue 12 years ago, and to put coronavirus relief checks to work:

>>“In other words, poor people have too much money and are now controlling the narrative. Damn those $1200 stimulus checks and $600 unemployment supplements. Too much liquidity, let's get these folks back to living paycheck to paycheck.”

>>“I know. Democratisation of the market is so damned inconvenient for those of us with money.”

>>“nobody cares about your hedge fund cronies!”

>>“Bloomberg defending the suits. Not surprised. They’re just mad the rubes are in on the joke now. Might this force the Fed’s hand? Too many regular people in on the game.”
 

>This is all fascinating. In the space of 12 years, the role of the short-seller has turned on its head. Back in 2008, it was the shorts who upset the status quo, revealed what was rotten in the state of Wall Street, and brought down the big shots. They were even the heroes of a big movie. It was the Wall Streeters who attacked them.

>Alienation has deepened since then. Short-selling hedge funds are now seen as part of a corrupt establishment, as is the media. The motives of anyone defending the shorts, or anyone wearing a suit, must be suspect. And there is a deep generational divide; those unable to own their own home and forced to rely on defined contribution pensions have a stunningly unfair deal compared to those a generation older, living in mortgage-free homes with guaranteed pensions. That percolates into anger, and a determination to right the scales by making money at the expense of corrupt short-sellers. 

>We lack precedents for an angry bubble, so predictions are even harder than usual. But there are enough similarities with past incidents to raise serious cause for concern.

>First, the little guys have had their success so far with the aid of margin accounts, and by using derivatives. We know what happens when these things are used to excess; even the Dutch tulipmania relied on margin debt and derivatives. Little guys (and everyone else) deserve safer tools with which to build wealth.

>Second, “democratization of finance” isn’t new, and in itself is nothing that anyone can object to. The problem is that investment and financial planning are difficult, and require time. Regulate these things, and you no longer have true democratization. Leave people free to take chances, and you get disasters like the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000. That also followed plenty of hype about the success of the “little guy,” and the first great explosion of online discount trading succeeded in sucking an army of new retail investors into the bubble’s final climax. Unregulated “democratization” led to the little guy bearing the brunt of the losses.

>“Democratizing” finance also leaves newly enfranchised financial citizens prey to spivs and frauds. I started my career covering the disastrous repercussions of one of Margaret Thatcher’s last reforms in the U.K. — giving people the right to leave their defined-benefit pensions, offered by employers, and take on defined-contribution “personal pensions.” Unscrupulous salesmen persuaded miners, firefighters and police officers to abandon copper-bottomed index-linked pensions for plans that came burdened with excessive charges. It was a repellent spectacle, and the bill for compensation was in the billions.

>These points doubtless make me appear to be a complacent shill for the financial industry, talking down to the rubes. For the record, I’m still angry about the way workers were ripped off in Britain more than three decades ago, and about the way the little guy ended up bearing the brunt for the financial implosions of 2000 and 2008. But it looks horribly to me as though the same thing is going to happen again — and I don’t think the answer to today’s many ills is to empower poor people to bankrupt themselves with margin accounts and derivatives.

>Anger, even more than greed, has the capacity to make us throw caution to the winds. Many of us have a lot to be angry about. If this carries on, and spreads beyond targets like a video-game retailer, I don’t want to see the consequences when history’s first angry bubble bursts.

The current PE is over 2000 and even if they keep growing at the rate they have been, some quick math ( high earnings forecast on yahoo) tells me it wouldn't go below 221 for 2022.

The Company seems fine, altough I think the security flaws ( that are probly fixed now) will probly have detered a lot of companies. At their current prices they would need 110 mil companies using the platform to get a PE of 60, if we'd assume a crazy 30% profit margin ( current profit margin is 2%). Imagine every paid user has 4 other ppl in the same call. That would give half a billion people using zoom. Even right now, with the lock down, that would be crazy.

Google has recently made Hangouts basicly free and Microsoft's Teams and Skype also look like tough competition for a startup. 

It feels like the market is priced to the best of the best scenario, but maybe I'm just missing something?

I've been thinking of selling call (probly strike 200- 250) options that expire jan 2022. Would be a very nice profit if the stock goes down or even sideways, and this way I don't have to nail the timing.
Edit: The reason I want to sell leaps is that I can't short stocks where I live and this mimics it well, pls tell me if I can do something better I'm still new to options.",2020-05-17 22:07:42
906,Buying Sears stock 30 years ago would return more than 16x your investment.,1055,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/aqhvo3/buying_sears_stock_30_years_ago_would_return_more/,240,"Suppose you bought your shares in Sears at the beginning of 1989. Back then, Sears Stock ($S) was trading at about $16 per share. You would have had purchased 6,200 shares of stock with a $100,000 investment. 

Sears stock paid dividends.

From 1989 through 2005, Sears would have paid you $125,000 in dividends.

In 1994, Sears spun off Allstate. Each Sears shareholder received 0.93 shares of Allstate for each share of Sears. So you got about 5,766 shares of Allstate. In July 1998, Allstate shares split 2:1. So now you would have had 11,532 shares in Allstate.

Allstate is currently trading at $94 per share. That’s $1,084,008

Allstate paid dividends. Since IPO, they would have paid $277,690 on all your shares. (Not reinvested)

In 1993, Sears spun off Dean Witter. Each shareholder of Sears got 0.39031 shares of Dean Witter for each share of Sears. You got about 2,400 shares of Dean Witter.

Dean Witter then acquired Morgan Stanley, (they took the Morgan Stanley name) In 2000, it split 2:1, so you now have 4,800 shares of Morgan Stanley. It split 1:3 in 2004, making your investment 1,600 shares. Morgan Stanley is now trading at $41.19. So you have $65,905 in Morgan Stanley.

Morgan Stanley paid dividends. A total of $65,688 since being bought by Dean Witter.

This brings your initial $100,000 investment in Sears in 1989 to **$1,618,291** without reinvesting dividends!

**Edits**: Commenters gave me some reminders of other spin-offs. 

Morgan Stanley spins off Discover in 2007, at 1 for every two $MS shares. This would give you 800 discover shares. Discover is currently trading at $69.72. This would net you a total of $55,776. 

But discover paid dividends! A total of $6,560 since you acquired the shares.  

In 2012, Sears spun off Sears Canada, giving each shareholder 0.42 shares per sears common stock. This would give us 2655 shares of Sears Canada. Sadly, this is only worth $50 flat today. Fortunately, they did pay dividends. A total of $34,515 since you acquired the shares. 
 
Sears spun off Lands End in 2014. Gave you 0.3 shares per SHLD share. You would have acquired 2295 shares of Lands End. At current share price, this would net you $39,451

Additionally, Sears still exists. Sears stock is worth $1.70 per share now. This would be an additional $13,953 on to your total return, given their split history.  

In total, your  return without reinvested dividends comes to **$1,768,596**

914,The coiled spring that is the uranium market (an update on the supply deficit and a 2021 outlook),1057,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ia7el4/the_coiled_spring_that_is_the_uranium_market_an/,589,"Edit: To everyone (and in particular the person kind enough to grant the platinum award, you legend): thank you for supporting this post and again feel free to send me a message if you have any questions or comments, have a great day and best of luck with your investments.

That's right, your monthly update on the sector that the majority of people seem to hate and has a total market cap almost equal to that of Pinterest. Yes, even I was suprised about this. A sector that provides fuel for powering 20% of the entire US and around 10% of all power generation globally has a combined market cap equivalent to a website where you can look for pictures of furniture (extremely simplified but you get the point).

But I digress, for those of you who have not read my previous updates and DD, [here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hp9966/the_case_for_a_big_uranium_bull_market_and_what/) is a general market analysis and five stock suggestions, [here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/huo47l/uranium_miners_are_showing_big_growth_with_many/) is a market update and lastly [here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i2bf4d/the_sector_that_returned_20x_50x_100x_and_even/) another update explaining the bullish views and recent drop. I would highly suggest you read these first before asking questions, since they will probably answer most questions you may have in the post itself or between the hundreds of comments. If you do have more questions, I will be more than happy to answer them for you.

Now, let's move on to the big one, what is happening in the sector? Well it looks like 2021 is going to be the year all catalysts come together to form one incredible bull market for uranium. 

Kazatomprom has publicly announced that their supply in 2021 will be severely impacted. Why is that? Because ISR mining in Kazakhstan is a lot like planting crops. A mining solution has to be put into the ground, which will go into the ore bodies and after between 4 and 7 months the solution can be pumped back out together with the uranium ore. The only problem is that the main 'seeding' months where between April and September, right before Kazakhstan winter. They have now missed their main mining time of the year, which means little to no new uranium will be pulled out of the ground next year for the first time in a long long time. With Kazakhstan responsible for just around 40% of the entire global supply of uranium, this impact will translate into a major supply deficit on top of the already existing supply deficit. This year it is estimated that there will be around 120 million pounds of uranium produced, where 180 million pounds was demanded. This means that inventory and mobile supply had to be used to fill this gap, further tightening the global supply of uranium. Let's talk about the wildest situation, which would be every single uranium producer, including at Olympic Dam, just ramps up to full capacity and sell everything into the market at whatever the current price is. Will that drop the price a bit? Sure it will. Will it take care of the deficit and prevent this bull market from happening? Absolutely not.

If this structural deficit happened to any other commodity, the price would absolutely skyrocket. So why hasn't uranium? Because there has been almost no talk of nuclear utilities, the main consumer of uranium, coming into the market to buy new fuel. This will change in 2021 and especially 2022 when 40% and 80% of all utilities in the US respectively will be out of contract and thus not getting their all important fuel for the nuclear power plants.

This contracting cycle comes at the same time as the biggest supply deficit we have yet seen, the closing of several high profile uranium mines, like Orano's Cominak mine, the lack of new uranium mines for at least the next 2/3 years and above all the increasing demand for uranium all across the globe make this entire sector a coiled spring. We do not know when it will go off, but the longer it stays this way the higher the jump and this jump will come. My guess is that there are several small bumps this year and that there will be a huge jump next year which will trigger a bull market that may even eclipse the likes of 2002-2007 and will last between 2-4 years depending on how long it takes for all utilities to sign new contracts and the market to be supplied well again, after which the market will come back down to 'normal levels'.

Lastly, there have been index funds who are restructuring their holdings to have more pure play exposure to uranium. $URA will move from 50% to 70%, adding 32 million dollars to the sector. With a sector that had such a small market cap, inflow of capital like this can move the needle substantially. Just imagine what will happen when the general investment community and all those people who made millions in the previous bull market decide to invest into the sector. That will do more than just moving the needle or spring the coil, that would put the needle and the coil into a cannon.

All signs point to this being the most asymmetrical risk/reward investment you can find in the market. I will not deny the risk it brings, but the potential rewards are so large that they easily write off any risk that might be involved investing in this sector. When all is set and done, those that invested early and held on through all the volatility will be greatly rewarded for their troubles.

Extras:
I highly suggest checking out people like Brandon Munro, the uranium insider, John Quackes, Crux Investor, Rob Chang and especially Mike Alkin who all have extensive information on the sector and the investment thesis.

This year alone, companies are on track to buy back $800 billion dollars of themselves (a 51&#37; increase from last year and another all time record) (citation: [http://fortune.com/2018/04/20/stock\-market\-buybacks\-nervous/](http://fortune.com/2018/04/20/stock-market-buybacks-nervous/)) . Most of these buybacks are centered in the tech sector that has subsequently experienced the most growth with the most gains when they did the most buybacks. Apple alone is buying back $100 Billion dollars this year. One figure alone said that many of the tech companies in the S&P 500 are planning to buy back as much as 10&#37; of their market caps. This normally wouldn't concern me that much except that there's this: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NCBDBIQ027S](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NCBDBIQ027S)

It's a chart of nonfinancial corporate business debt. (The fact that it's nonfinancial is significant because financial companies are typically quite leveraged, and high debt is just a sign of success) Now, the debt levels wouldn't concern me either if the money was being used to reinvest in the businesses, but they aren't. If companies were just using their excess cash to buy back stock and issue dividends, I would see it as just a business decision, but they are literally cannibalizing themselves by taking on massive loads of debt just to pump up their own stock prices. The majority of the new debt that isn't used for refinancing is used to buy back stocks. 

I see a direct parallel to the Mortgage Backed Security market of 2005. In a controlled environment, isolated failures would be absorbed by the larger system with minimal loss. When everyone is too leveraged though, a small failure can have catastrophic consequences. Back in 2004, I had a blog preaching a possible crash in the MBS market, and I was dead on right. The part I was wrong about was that I expected it to happen a LOT sooner than it did. Markets can behave irrationally for a LONG time. 

This is how I see this potentially playing out. Interest rates go up a percent or two because a company is too leveraged and because the whole bond market raises its rates (pretty much a sure bet this will happen), one company can't refinance its debt without showing a loss. So, they reissue a small amount of stock or just accept a reduction in their credit rating. The problem is when all the companies suddenly have to deal with this, the bond market would shift rapidly to higher interest rates to compensate for all the reductions in credit rating and an overall uneasiness about the state of the debt market. This would make the problem worse which would in turn make interest rates even higher. It's a feedback loop like the MBS crash and subsequent foreclosure crisis. Companies will be left with no choice but to reissue stock to raise capital, and that will crash the stock market resulting in much less money for the same amount of company sold. So, they will have to sell more resulting in bigger valuation reductions. In other words, I see a 25&#37; crash in the stock AND bond market in the imminent future. Once again, I'm probably calling this way too early like I did last time. So, this might not happen for two years, but it will most likely happen.

Hi Friends,

I’m writing this letter to you because I’ve identified you as someone who is or may be interested in learning more about long-term investing. I have too many friends who have decided that investing is too complex for them, and they either write off investing altogether or pay a mutual fund company thousands of dollars in fees over their lifetime. I have spent the past several years reading everything I can and teaching myself how to be a successful investor. I’m still very much an idiot, but I realize that my knowledge today can help you make better investment decisions for your future. 

*Someone’s sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago*. – Warren Buffett

I’d like to start with an introduction about my investing style.

***Dividend Value Investing***

*Time is the friend of the wonderful company, the enemy of the mediocre.* – Warren Buffett

My investing style closely resembles the value investing style espoused by Warren Buffett mixed with a heavy emphasis on dividends. Value investing is characterized by buying high quality, dividend paying companies at reasonable prices.  

How do I ensure a company is high-quality? A high-quality company will have a wide moat, meaning other companies will have a tough time gaining market share from the wide-moat company. An example of a company with a wide moat is Union Pacific Railroad. It is tough if not impossible for a company to come in, buy land, gain permits, purchase cars, and start laying tracks.

 I favor boring companies who sell products people will continue to buy 25+ years in the future. People will still need toothpaste, band-aids, and water 30 years from now. 

 I like companies that generate lots of cash each quarter. High quality companies exhibit stable, 10+ year trends of increasing earnings per share (EPS).  These companies should have management which uses this cash to make strategic acquisitions or returns this capital to shareholders via dividends (preferably both). 

Specific metrics I use to make sure a company is high-quality:

* **Dividend Yield > 2%** – This is how much the money you invest in a company will earn via dividends throughout the year. I like companies with a greater dividend yield than the general market. The sweet spot for dividend yield range tends to be 2.4-5%. Dividends are passive income currently taxed at a 15% rate.
* **Payout Ratio <70%** - Tells how much of a company’s earnings are currently being paid out via dividends. I want to ensure a company can continue to increase their dividend without eroding earnings.
*** Return on Equity  (5 year median) > 10%** - This formula tells how much net income is returned as a percentage of shareholders equity.  This formula is used to measure management’s effectiveness of using shareholder’s capital to generate earnings. High return on equity = high quality management.
* **Earnings Per Share (10 year growth) > 10** -  This shows on average how much a company increases its growth rate by over 10 years. I like to see companies who have weathered 10 years of the economic cycle, and still have managed to grow earnings by 10% on average. 
* **Debt to equity ratio <.55** – Debt to equity ratio is a measure financial leverage. It calculates a company’s total liabilities and divides it by shareholder’s equity. The lower the number the better as it means a company isn’t using debt to finance its assets. A low debt level ensures a company can withstand an economic downturn.

***Margin of Safety***

*Rule #1: Don’t lose money. Rule #2: Don’t forget rule #1* – Warren Buffett

Warren Buffett talks about ensuring your investments have “a high margin of safety”. Margin of safety is ensured by making sure the companies you are buying are undervalued, and able to withstand deteriorating market conditions. 
 
An undervalued company is not likely to go down as much during a recession as a highly valued, growth company. Investors get greedy during bull markets. Stocks like Netflix, Amazon, and Tesla get bid up on the expectation that money will keep flowing, and growth will continue forever in the double digits. In a recession, these high growth stocks drop the fastest and hardest. You instead want companies whose value metrics are relatively lower than the general market, as these companies offer safety in case the 7 year bull run goes the other way. 

Specific metrics I look at to check if a company is undervalued are:
 
* **PE (Price to Earnings Ratio) < market’s average** – Price to earnings measures the price of the stock divided by the earnings per share. This is a basic way to see how a stock is being valued compared to its past. I look at the forward PE because it takes the current price divided by the future year’s earnings estimates. This ratio provides a way to see what a company’s PE will look like if they meet their earnings estimates. 
* **PE< 10 year median PE** – A good way to check how PE compares to historical PE for the company
* **PS (Price to Sales Ratio) < 10 year PS** – Measures current price of stock to current sales. This compares to the historical PS average. 
* **PB (Price to Book Ratio) < 10 year PB** – Measures the price of the stock divided by the book value of the company. This compares to the historical PB ratio.
* **PE < Industry Avg PE** – We want the PE of the stock to ideally be lower than its industry’s PE. Certain industries will usually have a higher PE. Technology companies will usually have higher PE than a paper company.
* **EPS 10 year chart** A favorite method of mine to see if a company is undervalued is comparing the 10 year chart of a company’s stock price, with the 10 year earnings per share (EPS) overlayed. When the EPS is rising , and the share price is down, it’s a good indicator that shares are undervalued. This method was popularized in the book, Purple Chips.

***Dividend Growth***

*Compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it…he who doesn’t pays it* –Albert Einstein

When I buy stock in a company, I plan on holding it long term, ideally 20+ years. It’s important to me that a business/company can do well in recessions and bull markets. Slow and steady growth is the name of the game. Dividend growth is extremely important to me. Dividends have accounted for 30% of stock returns over the past 80 years. When management raises the dividend, it is the ultimate signal that management is confident earnings will continue to grow. Dividends cannot be fudged on accounting statements. The money is paid directly to you quarterly, and will be taxed at a 15% rate. 

If I buy a company currently yielding 5%, and it raises their dividend 10% every year, after 10 years I will be earning a 10% yield on my original investment, and this doesn’t include any stock price appreciation. Earning 10% on your money is unbeatable, even in a high-interest environment. My goal is to generate $80,000 in passive income via dividends to draw upon for retirement by 2036. 

***Market Timing & Greed***

*Time in the market beats timing the market.*

*Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful* – Warren Buffett

The biggest mistake people make with investing is letting their emotions of fear and greed interferes with sticking to a sound investment philosophy. Wall Street makes billions each year off naïve investors buying at the top, and then selling when things look like there is no hope.
  
The fact is the stock market is wildly unpredictable. Like a manic-depressive person, no one truly ever knows whether the market will go up or down. By investing in solid companies that pay dividends, you will make money no matter which way the market decides to go. It helps if your retirement date is 10+ years out. Time is on your side. You can withstand paper losses that recessions will bring. Don’t sell and keep reinvesting your dividends and extra capital. Slow and steady will win the race, and you will be rewarded for your patience and steady emotions.

*Over the long term, the stock market news will be good. In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a fly epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497*- Warren Buffett

***Companies I am Buying or Adding to My Positon:***

In order of largest to smallest holding percentage:

* 1. **Johnson & Johnson - JNJ**

My largest holding. JNJ is a diversified healthcare company. You probably know them for their consumer health business where they make band-aids, baby shampoo, and Tylenol. Their other 2 businesses include medical devices and their fastest growing-pharmaceuticals. JNJ has raised their dividend for 54 straight years. Their management is top-notch, and they are approaching a reasonable PE ratio of around 19. 

*  2.**Lockheed Martin – LMT**

Lockheed Martin is an aerospace and defense company who sells stealth jets, missile and radar systems, and space flight vehicles. Their customers are primarily the US government and its NATO allies. Lockheed’s price has increased recently with Trump and Republicans winning. People expect the US military to increase spending over the next 4 years. Lockheed pays a nice dividend of 2.8%. Management has grown profits very well over the past 10 years. Do I feel scummy investing in the military industrial complex? Sometimes. I also think there are a lot of bad people out there, and we need advanced weaponry to provide a deterrent against them. I expect Lockheed to do extremely well as governments continue to upgrade against global terrorism. 

* 3.**Royal Dutch Shell – RDS.B**

Royal Dutch Shell is an energy company selling oil, natural gas, and renewables. Like most energy companies, their prices has dropped significantly since the price of oil dropped from $100 to its current $50 a barrel. Shell has been moving away from oil, and recently spent $50 billion to acquire BG Group, the largest natural gas supplier. Shell’s dividend is currently 7%, and they are committed to paying it throughout this oil downturn. Oil may not reach $100 a barrel, but OPEC will not let oil continue to decline as it has over the past year. Since I wrote this, OPEC announced production cuts so that oil-dependent countries like Russia, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia can stop losing billions of dollars each year. Shell is paying you 7% to wait out this oil decline. The world will continue to need more energy, which is why I am adding to my holding. 

* 4.**Welltower – HCN**

Welltower is a healthcare Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that buys and manages senior housing, post acute care, and assisted living centers. REIT’s are required to pay out 90% of its profits in dividends, which is why Welltower is currently yielding 5.5%. Baby boomers are just at the beginning of retiring en masse. Anyone with an older relative realizes how important and necessary senior living centers are. Welltower has been paying dividends for 30+ years. I like Welltower as a stable income producing company who will experience growth for the next 10-20 years as people continue to get old, live longer, and utilize senior housing.

* 5.**Cisco – CSCO**

Cisco designs, manufactures, and sells Internet based networking products and services. Their bread and butter are data center and enterprise switches, routers, conferencing systems, and their fast-growing cyber security businesses. They are the market leader in helping computers talk with one another. Cisco current trades at a 12 forward PE, which is significantly lower than the general market’s PE of 20. Their PE and price to sales numbers are currently lower than their 5 and 10 year medians. Cisco has a great CEO in John Chambers. They have an operating margin of 25% and current free cash flow of 12b. Their dividend is a solid 3.5%. This is a great tech company to buy and hold.

* 6.**International Business Machines – IBM**

IBM is considered a dinosaur in the tech world, and some people foolishly write them off because of this. IBM is in the middle of a multi-year transformation away from traditional businesses like software and IT outsourcing to their “strategic imperative” businesses of big data & analytics, cloud mobile, and social/security. More recently, IBM has developed the AI technology, Watson. You may have seen Watson win the show Jeopardy a few years back. IBM has a low PE, huge cash reserves, and excellent returns on assets/equity. IBM has transformed itself multiple times in its 100+ year history. I will collect their 3.5% dividend yield as they do it again.

* 7.**Abbvie Pharmaceuticals – ABBV**

Abbvie is a research based company focusing on treating conditions such as Parkinson’s, HIV, cancer, dermatology, cystic fibrosis, and other conditions. Abbvie was spun off from the blue chip, Abbot Labs, in 2012. Abbvie’s stock price has remained stagnant over the past year as concerns about its top selling drug, Humira’s, patents due to expire. Humira makes up 60% of Abbvie’s sales. Abbvie has lawyers upon lawyers to postpone the expiration of its patent. I believe there is too much pessimism about Abbvie’s future earnings dropping. They trade at a forward PE of 12 compare to the industry average of 22. They have a return on equity and assets of 118% and 10% respectively. Management raised the dividend last month signaling they expect Abbvie’s earnings to continue to grow. They have a 5 year dividend growth rate of over 40%. Abbvie is a rare chance own a great pharma company while collecting a 4.3% dividend yield.

* 8.**Union Pacific Railways – UNP**

Who wants to own a railroad in 2016? Union Pacific runs several railways in the Western United States. These railways primarily ship coal, chemicals, and industrial products (do you know a President elect who like coal and building steel walls?). They have a duopoly with Burlington Santa Fe allowing them to command a 37% operating margin. They have grown their income 16% yearly over the past 10 years. Their dividend is currently 2.3%, but they have grown that dividend 16% over the past 5 years.  Union Pacific has an extremely wide moat. I used to think of railways as inefficient and non-environmentally friendly. Did you know railways can move freight 436 miles on one gallon of fuel. Try doing that in a semi or 747. 

* 9.**John Deere and Co – DE**

John Deere is known for their big green tractors, but they also sell dump trucks, loaders, excavators, and anything else to help farmers get better yields. We are currently in the middle of a 5 year lull in corn prices. When corn prices pick up, this gives farmers more money to upgrade their equipment. Deere is an extremely cyclical company, and their price has increased much in the past year as people expect corn prices to rebound. I’d wait for a pullback to initiate a position in them. Still they have an excellent brand, with a long history of rewarding shareholders. They currently yield 2.6% and are increasing their dividend 11% on a yearly average over the past 5 years.

* 10.**Novo Nordisk – NVO**

Novo Nordisk is a healthcare company whose two main businesses are diabetes and obesity care. I hope to never have to utilize their drugs and services, but I also understand I’m in the minority. Most people in the US and world are getting fatter. We rely on cars for transportation, sit at desks 8+ hours a day, and are too lazy to exercise. Even worse we have super cheap junk food at our fingertips 24/7. This trend is only continuing as billions of people in China and India enter the “modern world”. Sounds bleak, but don’t worry, Novo Nordisk is there to get you your insulin and diabetes devices. They are also involved with hormone replacement therapy products. Novo has sold off 40% this year over concerns of drug pricing pressure in the United States. They are at a 52 week low. They generate tons of money, yield 2.6%, and are trading at historic lows. 

* 11.**Cummins– CMI**

Cummins designs, manufactures, and distributes diesel and natural gas engines. They have a free cash flow of 1.5b, a forward PE of 14, and have grown earnings by 10% each year over the past 5 years. They currently yield 3%, with a long history of paying/increasing dividends. They have a strong brand in a great niche market. 


* 12.**Schweitzer-Mauduit International – SWM**

This is a new holding for me. SWM is a paper and plastics company. 60% of their business is in producing cigarette papers. Governments around the world mandate cigarette companies use their Lower Ignition Prospensity (LIP) papers. These papers ensure cigarettes do not light on fire when dropped to the ground. This business is slowing as cigarette consumption drops around the world. In 2012, new management came in and changed their strategy to diversify their business away from cigarette papers. They now make water filtration systems, tea bags, and other specialty products. The transformation is working as net income has grown 18% each year over the past 5 years. They have a return on equity /assets of 17 and 8%. Operating margin of 15%, and a forward PE of 12. Their debt to equity ratio is a little high at .51, but management is committed to paying down debt from their recent acquisitions. Even better their dividend yields 4%, and has grown 11% per year over the past 5 years. An upcoming catalyst for them could be selling papers to the marijuana industry. More states and countries countinue to legalize marijuana. These sales can help offset the decline of their cigarette business.  


* 13.**TD Bank – TD**

TD Bank is headquartered in Toronto, Canada. They have a great steady business with management that pays a dividend yield of 3.5%. Canadian banks are more steady growers than their riskier US counterparts. TD Bank has room to continue growing their earnings and dividend.

* 14.**Visa – V**

Visa is an anomaly in my portfolio. They trade at a high PE (29) and pay a paltry dividend (.86%). Visa is a growth stock. Visa runs the world’s largest payment network. They do not assume any of the responsibilities with fraud or credit card debt. They just collect their 2.5% on every transaction made when someone uses a card with Visa on it. The world will continue to use less cash as e-commerce grows. Visa has rarely traded at a reasonable PE ratio. This is mostly due to their incredible business. They have an operating margin of 65% with no signs on this slowing down.

* 15.**T Rowe Price – TROW**

T Rowe Price provides financial advice and mutual funds. They have grown their dividend 27 years in a row, and currently yield 2.9%. They are currently trading at a forward PE of 16 compared to their 10 year median of 24. Their business and management is truly a blue-chip. They have a return on equity/assets of 24 and 18%, showing that they can invest in themselves and make money. 

* 16.**Boeing – BA**

Boeing’s businesses are airplanes and defense. They are trading at a forward PE of 20.55 compared to a 10 year median of 28. They have 8.4b in free cash flow. Their dividend yield 3%. Their net income and dividends continue to grow. This a blue chip with a wide moat, and 42 years of dividend increases.

* 17.**Tesoro– TSO**

Tesoro refines petroleum and bio-fuel products. They also have a great gas station retail business. More and more Americans continue to drive, especially in the Western States where Tesoro operates. They have made strategic acquisitions that will allow them to continue paying a decent dividend (2.5%) and increasing their income. 

 
* 18.**Walmart – WMT**

Walmart is like IBM in that they are in the middle of a huge transformation, and they have a very, very long history of making successful transitions They were a little late to e-commerce, but concerns about Amazon taking them over were overdone. They have a huge transportation and logistics advantage over every retailer in the world. Their low price model has proven successful in China, Mexico, and India. They have made huge investments in e-commerce to compete with Amazon in the United States. At a PE of 15, and dividend growth for 41+ years, Walmart is still a bargain.

* 19.**Western Digital – WDC**

Western digital sells storage hard drives and solid state drives. Their business will continue to grow as more storage is needed for all of the pictures, videos, and data we continue to share. Their forward PE is 9, dividend yield of 3.4%. This is a great tech company that will reap the benefits from their aqusition of Sandisk.

* 20.**Nike – NKE**

Nike has been my worst performer over the past year (down 16%). Their PE has gone from 30 to 22, highlighting why it’s never good to pay a premium, especially in retail. I still think Nike has a bright future, and this is as good a time as any to buy part of the company. Their dividend was increased so that they yield 1.5%. If you have traveled overseas, you know how popular the brand is abroad. They still dominate in shoe sales. They own the brands converse, who’s Chuck Taylors remain popular. Athletic wear is a fast growing market. They recently announced their $700 self-lacing shoe called the HyperAdapt which has been sold out everywhere, and are currently being sold for $5000+ on ebay. I don’t like retail stocks, but Nike and VFC are the only companies in the space I would consider owning.


There you have it friends. I’d like to continue writing a letter like this once a year. My wife and I are having our first child next year, so I’m not entirely sure how much time or money we will have to invest. Still, please let me know if you would like to continue receiving these letters. I would love to hear your thoughts. A link to my investment workbook is below. Keep investing for the future.

A new economic-growth estimate from JPMorgan projects that a recession will hit the US and European economies by July.

The bank said its views of the coronavirus outbreak ""have evolved dramatically in recent weeks."" JPMorgan economists now expect US GDP to shrink by 2% in the first quarter and 3% in the second.

Eurozone GDP could contract by 1.8% and 3.3% over the same periods, the economists added.

The ""sudden stop"" to economic activity through quarantines, event cancellations, and social distancing contributed to the downward revision, alongside recent weeks of financial-market chaos.

932,Pros and cons of investing in 5 upcoming tech IPOs from Airbnb to Roblox,1038,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/k3e4rs/pros_and_cons_of_investing_in_5_upcoming_tech/,278," December and January aren't typically busy months for initial public stock offerings, but this time around, they'll be an exception. Almost a half dozen well-known tech startups, each already valued privately at over $1 billion, have recently filed for IPOs, including Airbnb, DoorDash, and Roblox.

 They're hoping to take advantage of strong investor appetite for tech stocks, despite the pandemic, and to catch the coat tails of other tech companies that have recently made [successful debuts](https://fortune.com/2020/08/29/2020-ipos-palantir-tech-ipo-asana-snowflake-predictions/). Shares in cloud database company Snowflake are up 129% since its September IPO and those of data mining company Palantir are up 215% since its September listing.

Here are key details to consider in weighing whether to invest in the latest batch of would-be public tech companies. Financial data is from the first nine months of 2020 unless otherwise indicated.

## Affirm

Symbol: AFRM  
Fiscal 2020 revenue: $510 million (fiscal year ended June 30)  
Revenue growth: 93%  
Gross margin: n/a  
Net loss: $113 million

[Affirm’s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm)

Founded in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Affirm aims to [bring credit and lending to customers of all kinds of online retailers](https://fortune.com/2020/02/05/credit-cards-levchin-affirm-ceo-daily/). Those hard-to-miss layaway offers for a pair of shoes from Cole Haan or that cute coffee table on West Elm’s website? Affirm works behind the scenes to process the loans and often covers the cost of the item (in some cases, partner banks fund the loans). So far, Affirm has signed up over 6,500 retailer and helped consumers pay for almost $11 billion worth of products over the past three years.

**Pros**: Affirm says its “buy now, pay later” system is superior to credit cards, with no hidden fees or high interest rates (most Affirm offers are zero interest rate). Like other hot consumer companies, Affirm also touts its net promoter score of 78, suggesting more than three-quarters of customers would recommend the company.  As e-commerce grows, there’s plenty of room for growth in the market—less than 1% of e-commerce transactions in North America relied on “buy now pay later” deals. And Affirm says its data analysis of consumers’ ability to pay lets it avoid major losses.

**Cons**: The largest e-commerce sites, like [Amazon](https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/) and [Walmart](https://fortune.com/company/walmart/), have no need for Affirm and could even launch their own lending services. So could big banks or other financial institutions that can borrow money more cheaply than Affirm can. And more than one-quarter of all of Affirm’s lending has so far come from customers of a single retail partner: Peloton.

## Airbnb

Symbol: ABNB  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $2.52 billion  
Revenue growth: -32%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $697 million

[Airbnb’s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)

As the now-famous story goes, Airbnb co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia decided to rent some airbeds in their San Francisco apartment after a big design conference caused local hotels to be fully booked. Their little web site, AirBedandBreakfast.com, eventually grew into the titan that has rented space to 825 million customers cumulatively across 220 countries.

**Pros**: The fast-growing startup took a huge hit when COVID-19 curbed travel, but has since [almost bounced back](https://fortune.com/2020/06/30/airbnbceo-brian-chesky-bookings-rentals-recovery-2020-ipo-coronavirus-pandemic/). Bookings were down 72% in April compared to the same month in 2019, but for June through September, the declined narrowed to 19% to 23%. The company also brags in its regulatory filing that pandemic-related spending cuts, including slashing headcount by 25%, make it more efficient going forward.

**Cons**: The pandemic showed that the travel industry is subject to sharp downturns that cut into Airbnb’s sales, and infections are on the rise again worldwide. The company has also battled restrictive rules in many cities and countries seeking to ban short-term rentals. Airbnb's filing disclosed it’s also in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service that could cost it $1.4 billion if it loses. And even after being in business for more than a decade, Airbnb is still on pace to lose around $1 billion this year.

## DoorDash

Symbol: DASH  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.92 billion  
Revenue growth: 226%  
Gross margin: 53%  
Net loss: $149 million

[DoorDash S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm)

After moving to the U.S. as a child, DoorDash co-founder and CEO Tony Xu worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant to help make ends meet. The point of DoorDash, he says, is to help strivers and small businesses thrive. Now in business for seven years, DoorDash “dashers” deliver food and other items from almost 400,000 businesses to 18 million consumers per month as of September.

**Pros**: DoorDash is the leading provider of delivery with over twice the market share of runner up Uber Eats as of October 2020. The pandemic has [ignited much faster growth](https://fortune.com/2020/05/25/coronavirus-jobs-food-delivery-doordash/) in food delivery as people avoid going out to eat. Some smaller players have already sold out (DoorDash bought Square’s Caviar service for $410 million last year), but further consolidation could let DoorDash charge more for its services.

**Cons**: Once the pandemic passes, many DoorDash customers [may return to eating](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/can-doordash-maintain-its-pandemic-boost/) in restaurants. Although California voters approved a measure to continue to classify gig workers like DoorDash’s dashers as independent contractors, other governments still are trying to classify gig workers as employees, which could wreck DoorDash’s business model.

## Roblox

Symbol: RBLX  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $589 million  
Revenue growth: 68%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $206 million

[Roblox S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm)

Much more than a video game, Roblox has become a virtual environment for millions of people and companies [to create their own games](https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/roblox-100-million-monthly-active-users/). Co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel went from making software simulations for physics labs to creating Roblox in 2004. Now some 31 million people play daily, including three-quarters of all U.S. kids age 9 to 12, the company says (Research firm Dubit put the figure at [half of kids 9 to 12 this summer)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/technology/roblox-tweens-videogame-coronavirus.html).

**Pros**: Roblox has plenty of reasons for developers to stick around, including its large devoted customer base and the Lua scripting language that makes it easier to make new games. About two-thirds of current users are from the U.S. and Canada, so there is room for considerable overseas expansion.

**Cons**: The pandemic super-charged Roblox growth rate, but kids may decide to put their screens down and play more outside after the crisis ends. Many users play on devices running [Apple](https://fortune.com/company/apple/) or [Google](https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/) software, putting Roblox somewhat at the mercy of the twin tech titans’ app policies. Other games have been banned and the app stores decide how much of each sale they are entitled to. A joint venture with Tencent to bring Roblox to China could be impacted by increasing trade tensions or new restrictions. And gaming and social media platforms come and go depending on the latest fads. Roblox could be the MySpace of gaming.

## Wish (ContextLogic)

Symbol: WISH  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.75 billion  
Revenue growth: 32%  
Gross margin: 65%  
Net loss: $176 million

[Wish S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312520298630/d82777ds1.htm)

Overshadowed by better known rivals like Amazon, [Alibaba](https://fortune.com/company/alibaba-group-holding/), and [eBay](https://fortune.com/company/ebay/), Wish [focuses its e-commerce services](https://fortune.com/2020/11/20/online-marketplace-wish-files-for-ipo/) on the “affordable” segment of consumers. Founded in 2010, Wish now helps more then 500,000 online sellers hawk goods to 100 million monthly active shoppers. Parent company ContextLogic has its name on the IPO registration filing.

**Pros**: Shopping online isn’t just for the wealthy. Wish says it's targeting the 44% of U.S. consumers and 85% of Europeans who have household incomes of $75,000 or less, plus shoppers in developing countries. Wish’s platform is mobile first, and 90% of purchases happen via its mobile app. Although Wish doesn't make a profit, it generated free cash flow (or cash from operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment) of $23 million in the first nine months of 2020.

**Cons**: Wish faces off against many larger rivals, such as Amazon, Alibaba and eBay, plus Shopify and Walmart. To compete against the giants, Wish spends vast sums, over $1 billion so far in 2020, on marketing. With deep connections in China, U.S.-based Wish could be hurt by worsening trade tensions. And as with other startups dependent on mobile apps, Google and Apple could undermine Wish’s business with new rules or requirements.

We have created spreadsheets to screen stocks and track our portfolios. We spent weekends working on automating them and making them usable for everyone here (inspired by u/mau2509’s awesome spreadsheet - thanks for sharing here!).

Here is the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AIC22xJtitg8leYTOsIYUBXgzIBAm6gAi8EccViEGrY/edit#gid=0)

You can go to *“File” > “Make a copy”* to save it. *Gray cells are the ones that take user input*, all other ones are automatically filled out.

There are 3 tables in the spreadsheet (all in “Main” sheet):

1. **“Purchased”**: enter the stock tickers you own with the number of shares. This helps you look at the total value of your position in a stock, total portfolio value and how much % is in each stock (useful for Rate My Portfolio).
2. **“Investment Tracker”**: enter your desired % allocation for each category (US stocks, International Stocks, Bonds) if you don’t like the default values. We find this useful to take into consideration how diversified our portfolio is before making buy/sell decisions, so that our portfolio is more robust to downturns specific to a certain category.
3. **“Decision Making”**: enter any stock ticker you’re screening to buy/sell. It will automatically fill out several metrics: current price; category and sector; total return over 1, 3, 5, 10 years; recommendation; 30-day trend; current, average and maximum P/E ratio (w/ % of how far the current value is from the average and from max); VWAP; RSI; current and forecasted EPS.

We added comments to explain most metrics and color-coded based on our subjective opinions on what numbers are good/bad for buying decisions (green for good, red for bad, yellow for neutral). You can also use this sheet for selling decisions with different conditions.

The “**Decision Making**” table can be used independently of the other ones for stock screening.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The pandemic sweeping the world will turn global economic growth “sharply negative” in 2020, triggering the worst fallout since the 1930s Great Depression, with only a partial recovery seen in 2021, the head of the International Monetary Fund said.

FILE PHOTO: IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva speaks during a conference hosted by the Vatican on economic solidarity, at the Vatican, February 5, 2020. REUTERS/Remo Casilli
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva painted a far bleaker picture of the social and economic impact of the new coronavirus than even a few weeks ago, noting governments had already undertaken fiscal stimulus measures of $8 trillion, but more would likely be needed.

She said the crisis would hit emerging markets and developing countries hardest of all, which would then need hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign aid.

“Just three months ago, we expected positive per capita income growth in over 160 of our member countries in 2020,” she said on Thursday in remarks prepared for delivery ahead of next week’s IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings.

“Today, that number has been turned on its head: we now project that over 170 countries will experience negative per capita income growth this year.”

If the pandemic faded in the second half of the year, the IMF expected a partial recovery in 2021, Georgieva said, but she warned the situation could also get worse.

“I stress there is tremendous uncertainty about the outlook: it could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic,” she said.

The IMF, which has 189 member countries, will release its detailed World Economic Outlook forecasts on Tuesday.

The novel coronavirus that emerged in China in December has raced around the globe, infecting 1.41 million people and killing 83,400, according to a Reuters tally.

Georgieva said the pandemic was hitting both rich and poor countries, but many in Africa, Asia and Latin America were at higher risk because they had weaker health systems. They were also unable to implement social distancing in their densely populated cities and poverty-stricken slums.

She said investors had already removed some $100 billion in capital from those economies, more than three times the outflow seen during the same period of the global financial crisis.

With commodity prices down sharply, emerging market and developing countries would need trillions of dollars to fight the pandemic and rescue their economies, she said.

“They urgently need help,” she said, estimating hundreds of billions of dollars would have to be pumped in from outside sources since those governments could only cover a portion of the costs on their own, and many already had high debts.

Georgieva said it was encouraging that all governments had sprung into action, enacting some $8 trillion in fiscal measures and massive monetary measures.

To ensure a future recovery, Georgieva called for continued efforts to contain the virus and support health systems, while averting export controls that could slow the flow of vital medical equipment and food.

“The actions we take now will determine the speed and strength of our recovery,” she said.

It was critical to provide affected people and companies with “large, timely and targeted” measures such as wage subsidies, extended unemployment benefits and adjusted loan terms, while reducing stress to the financial system.

Coordinated fiscal stimulus was critical, and monetary policy should remain accommodative, where inflation remained low.

“Those with greater resources and policy space will need to do more; others, with limited resources will need more support,” she said.

The IMF was created for times like these, and stood ready to deploy its $1 trillion in lending capacity, Georgieva said.

The Fund’s executive board had approved doubling its emergency funding to $100 billion to meet the requests of over 90 countries, and staff were racing to process those requests.

The IMF was also looking at ways to provide additional liquidity support, including through creation of a new short-term liquidity line, and solutions that would allow lending even to countries whose debt was unsustainable, she said.

The IMF was also looking to increase its Catastrophe Relief and Containment Fund, which provides grants for the poorest countries to cover IMF debt service payments, to $1.4 billion from around $200 million, she said.

To further aid the poorest economies, the Fund and the World Bank were urging creditors such as China and other countries to temporarily stop collecting debt payments on their bilateral loans.",2020-04-10 00:44:40

945,Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) - An in-depth Stock Analysis,1032,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/jyeh16/johnson_johnson_nyse_jnj_an_indepth_stock_analysis/,113,"# Introduction:

Good morning everyone. It is apparent that JNJ is going to win the poll (on r/dividends), so here is the post as promised. The poll still has a little time, an analysis will be done for whichever stock is in 2nd place, and last place. Additionally I am considering grabbing one from the comments.

Anyways, Since this is a more in-depth look at the stock we will be answering the same questions again.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

1. Is there revenue growth?
2. Is there earnings growth?
3. Is the company really leveraged?
4. Is there strong cash flow?

Let's start by taking a look at the business model and moat.

# JNJ - Johnson & Johnson:

Johnson & Johnson is classified as a Dividend King, they have paid dividend continuously since 1963 and increased for 58 consecutive years.

Johnson & Johnson is the world’s largest and most diverse healthcare company. Three divisions make up the firm:

* pharmaceutical,
* medical devices and diagnostics,
* consumer good/discretionary

The pharmaceutical and medical devices account for \~80% of sales and generates most of the cash flow. The drug division focuses on the following therapeutic areas:

* immunology,
* oncology,
* neurology,
* pulmonary,
* cardiology,
* metabolic diseases.

The device segment focuses on surgery tools, orthopedics, vision care, and a few others. The last segment of consumer focuses on baby care, beauty, oral care, over-the-counter drugs, and women’s health.

**Strengths:**

>\-  Johnson & Johnson is one of the well known and trusted brands in the world. It it one of the most consistent earnings growers.  
>  
>\- Their 3 healthcare segments provide unequaled diversity of quality products for the healthcare industry.  
>  
>\- Developed nations have populations whose average age is increasing rapidly. Older people consume, on average, 7 times as much healthcare services and products as younger people. In addition, the growing global middle-class will be consuming an increasing amounts of healthcare. This will further increase their sales.  
>  
>\- The company is more resistant to competitors due to its established distribution network and sales.

**Risks:**

>\-  Litigation surrounding several J&J products have the potential to blemish the company’s reputation and cost billions of dollars. There is currently an ongoing talcum powder lawsuit.  
>  
>\- They are subject to more broad threats to the privatized healthcare industry, to include: increased regulation/scrutiny from consumers and government, plans for more government run healthcare, and increased risk of higher lawsuit costs. There are plenty of other threats to the healthcare industry as a whole, however JNJ is more resistant to the institution of gov't funded healthcare since they provide so many products. However there is always the threat of decreased profit margins as regulations call for price fixing.  
>  
>(NOTE: This is not an endorsement for or against either Government Funded/Privatized Healthcare, this is simply mentioning a potential risk to the company due to a changing environment, nothing more)

# Financial History:

One thing that is really nice about Johnson and Johnson is their company financial performance sheets give 10 years of history, most of the time companies will just do 3, or 5 years, so they are definitely not trying to hide anything, and as we will see below, they have no reason to.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$65,030|$19,389|$14,179|0.7|
|2013|$71,312|$23,161|$15,123|0.7|
|2015|$70,074|$22,116|$15,200|0.7|
|2017|$76,450|$24,539|$32,183|1.3|
|2019|$82,059|$28,079|$28,579|1.0|

The revenue has increased an average of 3% average, the earnings has increased faster than the top line revenue at 4.7% average, and they are very under-leveraged when it comes to debt, especially compared to some recent companies we have seen (IBM, KO, PEP).

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|14,298|2,893|15,859|
|2015|19,569|3,463|16,113|
|2019|23,416|3,498|17,098|

Increases straight across the board. CFO has increased 6% average, their CAPEX has increased by an average of 2%, but regardless their Free Cash Flow to Equity ratio is increasing despite them putting more money back into the company. They have been using some of their additional cash flow to pay down debt, the debt payment for 2019 was $2.82 Billion. Dividend Payments accounted for \~$10 Billion, and with some of the remaining the company bought back shares.

So ...

1. Is there revenue growth?  - Yes
2. Is there earnings growth? - Yes
3. Is the company really leveraged? - Very low debt
4. Is there strong cash flow? - Yes

# Some other numbers:

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$4.04|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|2.76%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.9%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.0%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.9%|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|64.64%|

From a dividend growth standpoint, this would potentially be a great portfolio inclusion. With many companies the 1/3 year dividend growth has been decreasing, JNJ has been maintaining and they have strong prospects of increasing the dividend growth rate again.

Let's project what the Annual Dividend Payout could be using a 6% constant growth rate. (NOTE: Just an estimate, not a guarantee of what could happen)

|Year|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Payout|$4.28|$4.53|$4.81|$5.10|$5.40|

Delicious.

# Final Thoughts:

From a financial perspective, JNJ is incredibly healthy, they have increasing revenue, earnings, low-debt, and high cash flow. Additionally, they responsibly uses their cash flow to pay down debt, pay their shareholders, and buy back shares. Furthermore, the dividend history and growth is very consistent.

There are definitely some risks to consider, the company does face lawsuits often enough and the details/payouts for those were not discussed here. Additionally the health care sector is more subject to a changing environment due to the expansion/introduction/rollback of regulations and expansion of public healthcare options. Take this into consideration.

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research.

As always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!

952,Nikola and GM team up to make 900-horsepower super electric truck,1020,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ios954/nikola_and_gm_team_up_to_make_900horsepower_super/,464," 

Nikola ([NKLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NKLA?p=NKLA&.tsrc=fin-srch)📷) and GM ([GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM)📷) are teaming up to take on Tesla’s cybertruck.

The electric truck startup announced Tuesday it has selected GM to be its manufacturing parter for its electric pickup truck dubbed the Badger. The Badger will use GM’s widely acclaimed Ultium battery technology. Additionally, Nikola will hand over $2 billion in stock to GM — giving the automaker an 11% stake in the company.

“Nikola is one of the most innovative companies in the world. General Motors is one of the top engineering and manufacturing companies in the world. You couldn’t dream of a better partnership than this,” said Nikola founder and executive chairman Trevor Milton in a statement. “By joining together, we get access to their validated parts for all of our programs, General Motors’ Ultium battery technology and a multi-billion dollar fuel cell program ready for production. Nikola immediately gets decades of supplier and manufacturing knowledge, validated and tested production-ready EV propulsion, world-class engineering and investor confidence. Most importantly, General Motors has a vested interest to see Nikola succeed. We made three promises to our stakeholders and have now fulfilled two out of three promises ahead of schedule. What an exciting announcement.” 

Added GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra, “This strategic partnership with Nikola, an industry leading disrupter, continues the broader deployment of General Motors’ all-new Ultium battery and Hydrotec fuel cell systems. “We are growing our presence in multiple high-volume EV segments while building scale to lower battery and fuel cell costs and increase profitability. In addition, applying General Motors’ electrified technology solutions to the heavy-duty class of commercial vehicles is another important step in fulfilling our vision of a zero-emissions future.”

Thus far, the Badger has been a mere rendering that has lit-up social media feeds.

The company did begin taking pre-orders for the electric super pickup truck in late June. On paper, the truck stands to be a beast. It’s expected to have 906 horsepower and have a 600-mile range using both battery and hydrogen fuel cells. Nikola has said pricing will start at $60,000 for the electric vehicle version and $90,000 for the one that also includes the hydrogen cell.

The Badger is expected to be unveiled in early December. Production has been set for 2022.",2020-09-08 22:59:49

Note it looks like this behavior is no longer happening but it would seem that in the whole realm of payment for order flow Robinhood erred too hard on the side of accepting payment and not hard enough on the side of looking for price improvement.

They've retained a consultant to ensure this isn't an issue going forward but it would seem to be vindication for those that complained about RH's execution. 

https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2019/finra-fines-robinhood-financial-llc-125-million-best-execution

>FINRA found that for more than a year, Robinhood—which offers its customers the ability to trade in equity securities without being charged commissions—routed its customers’ non-directed equity orders to four broker-dealers, all of which paid Robinhood for that order flow. This arrangement is known in the brokerage industry as payment for order flow.

>FINRA Rule 5310—Best Execution—requires firms to use reasonable diligence to ascertain the best market for the subject security and buy or sell in such market so that the resultant price to the customer is as favorable as possible under prevailing market conditions. FINRA member firms that route customer orders away for execution can satisfy their best execution obligations by conducting either an order-by-order review of execution quality or a “regular and rigorous review.” FINRA Rule 5310 enumerates a number of criteria for firms to evaluate in these reviews. 

>During its reviews, Robinhood did not reasonably consider the Rule 5310 execution quality factors (such as price improvement) that the firm could obtain from alternative markets. Instead, Robinhood’s Best Execution Committee materials focused only on the execution quality of its pre-existing routing destinations, all of which paid Robinhood for that order flow.

It should be noted that 1.25MM is pretty tiny.",2019-12-21 05:11:45

957,[Bloomberg] Day Traders Will Have Fun Until They Get Wiped Out,1020,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hfca7h/bloomberg_day_traders_will_have_fun_until_they/,363,"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-06-23/robinhood-traders-will-have-fun-until-they-get-wiped-out

One time when I was sitting in my college dormitory, I heard a whoop of joy from down the hall. My dormmate announced that he had just made $500,000 trading in the stock market, after having invested only a few thousand dollars. When I asked him how he did it, he grinned and simply said: “Call options.” I spent the rest of the day reading about how this marvelous financial instrument could be used to make a fortune in a day with just a small initial stake.

Of course, my lucky dormmate doubled down on his investment and ended up losing most of his money when the dot-com bubble burst a couple of months later.

This saga illustrates the danger of day trading, especially with leveraged instruments such as options. After the 2000 tech bust, day trading declined, but the coronavirus pandemic seems to be driving something of a renaissance. Goldman Sachs Investment Research reports that the percent of trading volume in the stock and option markets from small trades has increased a lot since January, while discount brokerage TD Ameritrade reports that visits to its website teaching people how to trade stocks have nearly quadrupled. Robinhood, a trading app that offers zero-commission trades and a simple, video-game-style interface, had 3 million new accounts opened in the first quarter. Half of its new customers are first-time investors. Many online communities are filled with the standard elements of day-trader culture -- stories of fabulous fortunes gained, hot tips, trading systems and theories and so on.

Coronavirus probably isn’t the only reason for the boom in day trading. Brokers realized that they could offer zero-commission trades and make up for it with interest earned  by lending out their cash balances. Mobile apps made trading easier and more fun than ever, and allowed new traders to start off with small amounts of cash. A new generation of speculators has no painful memory of the dot-com bust.

But whatever the reasons, the new day trading mania is not likely to result in a happier outcome than the last one. There are many theoretical reasons and a wealth of empirical evidence to suggest that most day traders are wasting their money.

One of the most important concepts in finance -- and yet seemingly one of the hardest to understand -- is that there are two sides to every trade. For a day trader to make money, someone else has to lose money. In the most optimistic case, the loser could be a normal person who needs to put money in or take money out of their retirement account, and who therefore doesn’t worry much about the price at which they buy or sell. But most trades are not this. Instead, day traders are usually buying and selling either from each other, or from algorithms programmed by skilled, experienced financial professionals. If it’s the former, their trading is a zero-sum game. If it’s the latter, human day traders are very likely to lose because the people who program trading algorithms are typically very smart, and their computers can spot market-moving developments faster than people can. This is why professional human traders have been increasingly driven out of the market.

A related problem is the idea of slippage. Day traders might think that because they’re paying zero commission, their trades are free. But when a day trader places an order, a trading algorithm somewhere quickly figures out that they want to buy or sell, and raises or lowers the price accordingly, so that the day trader gets a less favorable price.

Another reason day trading is a bad idea is that people often fail to understand when they’re winning and losing. If the market as a whole goes up (as it has recently), many stocks will be winners. That can make a day trader feel like they won, even if they would have made as much or more money if they had simply bought an index fund and held onto it. This is especially true right now, when correlations between stocks are very high -- in this case, meaning many stocks are rising or falling together.

Finally, day traders often don’t understand the amount of risk they’re taking. Call options of the type my college dormmate bought, for example, are a form of leverage -- you might make fabulous riches, but you’re very likely to lose your money. One young novice investor tragically committed suicide after seeing his account generate large losses; though he probably misread the account statement, this incident drives home the point that investors may not be prepared for how much money they can lose with the trades they’re making.

A large amount of empirical evidence confirms that most day traders lose money. A very large 2004 study of Taiwanese day traders, for example, found that more than 80% lost money. A tiny number -- about 0.03% -- earned consistently large profits, but the odds of possessing this kind of skill are slim. Most studies of day traders in the U.S. and Finland yield similar results -- a few traders are consistently good, but most lose out.

Day trading might therefore be a fun way of gambling for those who are locked inside waiting out the pandemic. But if regular Americans start betting large amounts of their money on individual stocks and options, they’re courting financial ruin. If you want to day trade, the best thing to do is to bet only a small percent of your money to learn whether you’re one of the few who has the skill to beat the market. Day trading should be treated like an expensive video game, not like a way of getting rich quick.",2020-06-25 11:01:03

Dozens of companies have begun shifting their supply chains from China to other locations, although most stay outside the United States, disappointing Trump’s hopes of a large-scale reshoring of lost factory jobs.

The president last week repeated his contested claim that Americans “aren’t paying for” the tariffs. The most comprehensive analyses to date — a pair of studies by economists from institutions such as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Princeton University, the World Bank and Yale University — concluded that Americans are paying the entire bill.

Yet for all the talk about tariffs, the aggregate economic effect has been modest. Inflation remains below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. And although some businesses have postponed planned investments, consumer spending in the factory and farm communities most exposed to the trade war has been unaffected, economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch reported earlier this month.",2019-07-29 04:37:58

966,Some tips on buying when the market falls,1009,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/jmy2im/some_tips_on_buying_when_the_market_falls/,417,"So I've seen some posts here about people asking about when to buy stocks during this market ~~downturn~~ pullback/correction. And I've been trying to figure it out myself and I came up with some ideas that seem useful.  This is perhaps my third market ~~downturn~~pullback/correction and I feel like I've gotten a lot better at it since the first time.

1-Nobody knows beforehand where the exact bottom is beforehand. Everybody has ideas, but most of them are wrong. If you think the market is gonna bottom in a week and you're waiting for it to bottom, you'll probably miss the boat.

2-Different stocks and industries bottom on different days. For example, cruises bottomed on a different day than tech stocks over the past week. Cruises bottomed on the 28th or 29th. Whereas tech stocks bottomed on the 30th and today. (this could change as the week progresses, but I'm guessing that these stocks have already bottomed for this downturn. I could be wrong though.)

3-The best time to buy is going to be around the time when you're scared and kind of hesitant because you think prices might drop more. This is when prices tend to be most depressed. Not only are you feeling this way, but so is everybody else.

4- Since you probably don't know how long the downturn will last and how severe it will be, I recommend a strategy of buying on different days instead of dropping all your money all at once on the first day.

5- Try to buy after the downtrend reverses. Don't buy before the trend reversal. It takes some practice to be able to identify when this happens. But generally, get a good chart of your stock using thinkorswim or some other problem. Watch the price action and set up a simple moving average. The MACD indicator can also help. As the downtrend continues, the price will rally a little. Most of these rallies will be false rallies and the price will drop further after the rally. At some point, you'll see a particularly strong rally and that may be a trend reversal. You can take a chance at buying in at that point. In case you're wrong, it would be wise to set a stop loss slightly below your entry point. You can also use a trailing stop loss. At some point, one of those big rallies is gonna be the real thing. And then you'll be in.

6- Don't worry if you miss the bottom. You can still get in at a good price if you're a little late or early. A lot of people miss the boat entirely or they panic sell and don't get back in. You're beating all of those people already.

7. Try to buy the securities that you think will recover strongly and quickly. There's no point in buying in a market downturn if you end up with a stock that doesn't recover or takes many years to do so. (some people will disagree with me here) Or worse, a stock that falls further.

8. Don't be afraid to experiment. The more market ~~downturns~~pullbacks/corrections you go through, the better you'll get at it. And the better you get at it, the more money you'll make. there's big money to be made in a very short amount of time in these ~~downturns~~pullbacks/corrections.",2020-11-03 09:40:57

So, my question is, how will that happen and what will The Great Unwinding look like when it does?

• what is the effect on markets when bond/corporate bond-buying by the Fed ceases, and who loses and who benefits (this may involve tracking individual companies to short/buy based on their debt and credit facilities utilization)?  
• what is the effect on markets when windows close on Cares Act related loans and grants, and who loses and who stands to benefit? What do we look for there?  I've read an article that said no one knows what companies will actually be solvent and which will not because that info is currently hidden behind the loans and grants.  
• what is the effect on markets when the window closes on Cares Act related unemployment benefits, and which stocks stand to lose and which stocks stand to benefit (bank/credit stocks lose & defensive Wal-mart style stocks benefit?)?  
• what is the effect on markets if this new stimulus package proceeds, as they suggest it will, in mid to late July?  
• how will The Great Unwinding of the most massive stimulus ever affect inflation and what are the factors that can tip us to inflation or deflation? (This is very relevant to me because investing in some foreign stocks as a hedge against a big inflation move of the USD is a part of my strategy)?   
• what is the true risk of downside so long as the Fed and the US gov has its stimulus hat on? What factors, if they exist, could defeat the US gov's attempts to prop up market values during this time and are they so-called ""tail-risk"", ""black swan"" events like a new SARS-CoV emerging while SARS-CoV2 is still in pandemic mode?

I don't know about anyone else but being on top of these questions seem more relevant to my investment decisions for the rest of the summer & early Fall than the things that value investors typically look at. As far as coronavirus infection factors, I think every investor is looking at those, so I think analyzing the stimulus and how The Great Unwinding might go down is the only thing I feel I haven't gotten a handle on. I think it would be cool if reddit get good at analyzing this aspect of our current market situation.

We bought the property based on hearing so many people talk about how incredible real estate is as an investment (Bigger Pockets, our realtor, and many wealthy older people). Now that all is said and done - we did our repairs and have renters in - I did a full projection of our property with some estimated (conservative) appreciation, all of the tax benefits, etc. In the end I think a conservative stock portfolio managed by a professional would do better over a 10-20 year period. I believe that our house will perform decently compared to other real estate investments, so this question isn’t about our house in particular, but really all real estate vs stock market decisions.

I’ve talked to a few people who have invested in real estate about this, and they seem hung up on the real estate return figures. I can’t get them to realize that just because you’re not actively losing money doesn’t mean you’re not leaving money on the table.

1000,Here's the evidence that we're not in a bubble,972,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l1upan/heres_the_evidence_that_were_not_in_a_bubble/,616,"Hello,

Markets are continuously rising and it seems we're in a bubble. I have some cash to invest, so I was wondering whether markets are overvalued and that I should wait, or should I invest right away.

What I did to investigate this was to compare S&P 500 with M2 Money supply. My hypothesis is that the rise that we're seeing is because of the extra money supply. If that is the case, then the real question we should be asking is **whether market's rise has overshot the money supply.**

From the data, it doesn't look like so. Take a look at the historical chart of S&500 / M2 money supply.

[https://imgur.com/a/ctrbC4E](https://imgur.com/a/ctrbC4E)

You can play with the [dataset here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18S9anxRQAD6-865Mrdj6Xyr5DiFifSbef2AlFselWQc/edit?usp=sharing).

**From the data and the chart, it's clear that the markets may rise even further**. Reasons:

* The ratio reached its peak during the 2000 bubble, and the current levels of the ratio are much below that (although they're reaching the 2008 levels)
* Since early 2020, M2 Money supply has roughly increased by 24% while S&P has increased by 15%

It's also interesting to notice that CAGR of this ratio over last 40 years comes to be around 2% which is similar to the annual increase of US GDP.  Another way to look at this is that, the 8% annual returns of S&P 500 over the last 40 years can be broken down into two parts:

* 6% annual growth in money supply
* 2% annual growth in GDP

So, in some sense market's real growth has been simply the GDP growth.

What do you think about this analysis?

**Powell: Fed open to private sector collaboration in possible digital dollar** 

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Monday that the Fed is open to collaborating with the private sector on a possible digital U.S. dollar, but reiterated that the central bank has not committed to actually launching one.

“We will have lots of conversations with industry and stakeholder engagement, and that’ll help us in our work on digital currencies and cross-border payments,” Powell said in an International Monetary Fund panel.

Powell said private sector initiatives like Facebook’s Libra project have accelerated central banks’ interest in setting up their own digital currencies.

But Powell cautioned that the Fed faces “difficult policy and operational questions,” such as the monetary policy implications of a digital dollar. Powell also listed illicit activity and cyber attacks as risks.

“I actually do think this is one of those issues where it's more important for the United States to get it right than it is to be first,” Powell said.

Powell pointed to the importance of the U.S. dollar in the global economy, noting that the majority of the $2 trillion Federal Reserve notes in circulation are held outside of the country.

Powell emphasized that any possible digital dollar would serve as a “complement” to physical cash — not a replacement.

&#x200B;

**Real-time payments**

The U.S. finds itself lagging other countries on payments infrastructure. The Bank of Mexico last year launched a Cobro Digital (CoDi) system that allows users and merchants to transact in digital pesos using QR codes. The People’s Bank of China recently began user testing a digital renminbi, which would allow transactions even without connection to the internet.

Although the Fed is not committing to launching its own digital currency, the Fed is charging ahead with its efforts to bring real-time payments among financial intermediaries. Services like Venmo and Cash App offer quick peer-to-peer payments, but check clearing still takes days for funds to arrive at one’s checking account because of aged infrastructure connecting the nation’s banks.

The Fed hopes to stand up a FedNow system to allow 24/7 real-time payments by 2023 or 2024. Kansas City Fed President Esther George, one of the leaders on the initiative, said the project is “on track” with that timeline.

Although many central banks are researching digital currencies, only about 10% say they will actually issue one of their own in the short-term, according to the Bank of International Settlements.",2020-10-20 01:01:43

The novel coronavirus has an unlikely victim -- one of the world’s most popular beers.

Corona has become the subject of memes and videos shared on social media as the toll from the virus climbs worldwide. Reports of an increase in online searches for “corona beer virus” and “beer coronavirus” show the Mexican beer hasn’t been able to escape the association. The so-called purchase intent among adults in the U.S. has plunged to the lowest in two years, according to data from YouGov Plc.

The damage has become more severe in recent days as infections spread. Shares of Corona-maker Constellation Brands Inc. dived 8 per cent this week in New York. Corona’s buzz score -- which tracks whether American adults aware of the brand have heard positive or negative things about it -- has tumbled to 51 from a high of 75 at the beginning of the year, YouGov said.

Corona, which derives its name from the Sun’s corona and has nothing to do with the virus, is the third-most popular beer in the U.S., according to YouGov rankings. Guinness is first and Heineken is second.

Another reason for the drop in purchase intent could be the perception of Corona as a summer beverage associated with beach holidays, YouGov business data journalist Graeme Bruce wrote in an article published Wednesday. It therefore has substantial seasonal fluctuations, he said.",2020-02-28 01:48:08

The conclusion the video comes to is that you should just stick to low cost index funds (preferably globally diversified) rather than investing into large cap growth or trying to find the next Apple or Amazon.

**EDIT:** The definition of a ""growth"" company (as literally explained in the video) is a company that is ""expensive"" relative to the market. Expensive how? Well, relative to some fundamental ratio like P/B or P/E. Considering all the companies I have listed in my title have relatively high P/E and P/B ratios, you can say they are expensive. This makes them by definition a growth company. This isn't that hard to understand. If I said they are tech companies, no one would argue because they literally are tech companies. Well, just as much as they are tech companies, they are growth companies. They might not all be as expensive as each other, but relative to the market, they are expensive.

I am not commenting about how all these companies are as overbought as each other, or they are the same in every metric, I just listed some large-cap growth companies based on the definition of growth being expensive.",2020-09-23 02:23:35

I was digging through some congress bills at work today when I stumbled upon something interesting - something *golden*.  Enlightenment, if you will.  [S.4232, 113th Congress, aka the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act.](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2432)

To put it briefly, the act was calling for changes to student loans, to allow borrowers to refinance unpaid debt and thereby alleviate the growing pressure of tuition on middle- and lower-class families.  

[Here's a brief .pdf that makes arguing points in support of the bill.](https://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/Warren%20Refinancing%20-%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf).  

Ultimately, the bill was never passed - but the arguments for it remain.  

> Key federal economic agencies like the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have weighed in on the dangers of exploding student debt. This debt is stopping a growing proportion of families from buying homes, saving for retirement, and making purchases that will keep our economy on the road to recovery

Sound familiar?  How many articles have come out asking about how and why millennials are ""killing"" major industries? (if you haven't kept up, [this marketwatch article makes for a nice recap](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/here-are-all-of-the-things-millennials-have-been-accused-of-killing-2017-05-22).)  It's easy to see that student loans put economic pressure on millennials, and perhaps change their spending habits in interesting ways.  

But besides small spending behavior changes, student loans are killing spending altogether. 

Let's take a look at [some recent data](https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/).   

44,000,000 Americans with student loan debt. 
Average loan delinquency rate of 11.2%.  
$1,440,000,000,000 estimated total U.S.  student loan debt.

""In 2012, 71 percent of students graduating from four-year colleges had student loan debt:

    Represents 1.3 million students graduating with debt, increase from 1.1 million in 2008
    66 percent of graduates from public colleges had loans (average debt of $25,550)
    75 percent of graduates from private nonprofit colleges had loans (average debt of $32,300)
    88 percent of graduates from for-profit colleges had loans (average debt of $39,950)""

""...the average Class of 2016 graduate has $37,172 in student loan debt, up six percent from last year.""

Combined with inflation and an overall lack of wage increases, the real cost of college is growing almost exponentially. 

The ultimate effect?  Macroeconomic slowdown.  Let's break it down: 

- Tuition is rising.
- Wages for graduates have not grown in pace with tuition / inflation.
- Graduates are left with less money in their pockets to spend.
- The businesses that serve a younger audience begin to feel pressure; their usual customers can no longer afford their products / services. 
- These businesses then see declines in revenue, forcing them to slow operations and potentially lay off employees. 
- The cycle spirals. 

If the market is driven by money (and it is), then it's bound to happen.  Let's look back to our key players - the education industry, and student loan providers.  

Colleges and universities are in a wonderland of profitability - the public has committed itself to paying more and more every year for a service that we've decided is 'essential' to a successful life.  While other industries that market towards young people are suffering, the education industry has yet to feel the pain - colleges will be the last thing that the current rising generation gives up for economic reasons (since we bombard children with the idea that they will never be successful without a college degree, and everyone wants to make at least some money).  If motivated by money, colleges have no reason to lower tuition rates until a major economic failure (that disrupts loaners) forces them to do so. 

Loan providers, too, have little reason to change.  In 2014, the U.S. government stood to profit over $60,000,000,000 on loans from 2007-2012 alone (https://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/Warren%20Refinancing%20-%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf).  That type of money isn't easy to give up, even for a country like the United States - and nobody is calling for them to do the right thing here.  They won't feel any reason to change until returns on defaulted loans drop to the point where no one purchases the outstanding debt.  As mentioned before, college (and therefore, student debt) will be the last thing the current generation gives up for economic reasons - meaning that by the time repayment plummets, other industries will have already been affected by several quarters (or more) of revenue loss due to lower spending by millennials.

1022,AMD: Undervalued at $90,955,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l0hxe5/amd_undervalued_at_90/,408,"AMD is reporting their Q4 2020 results on the 26th. As a long-term investor and given all the events in the past months I believe AMD is still undervalued at $90. I’ve made a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kwfxp7/amd_still_undervalued_at_95/) about this but there was some news last week which I incorporated in here is well.

&#x200B;

**Intel struggles**

Last week Intel has announced that they will replace Bob Swan with Pat Gelsinger as their CEO. This has led to Intel stock going up 13% and AMD dropping 5-6%. Intel is trading above(!) above the stock price they were when they announced the delays in 7nm/5nm. I think this reaction is severely overdone. Note that Pat used to be CTO at Intel for many years and is not the fresh blood they need to turn this colossal company around. Also in the time he was CEO of VMware (since 2012) the stock only rose 60% which is not a great performance comparing it to competitors. Intel has already announced their Q4 ER will beat estimates but that was a given. The only thing that is relevant is their outlook, which is still going to be meager since a CEO impact the company over years time (see AMD themselves) . AMD popped 12% on Intel Q2 report when they first announced their delays. We could see something similar if Intel gives a weak guidance for the coming year(s)

&#x200B;

**AMD Q4 and FY**

EPS Q4 consensus estimate is 0.47 with a range between 0.43 to 0.58. I believe revenue will be higher than expected, mainly due to the huge demand in the console market (PS5/Xbox) but also the PC/notebook market in general since half of the world was in (semi) lockdown for some parts of Q3/Q4. The main thing I am hoping for is that profit margin stays (roughly) the same at 44%, even though margins on consoles are very thin. If they manage to maintain a margin above 40%, EPS could end up 0.55, which would be a 360% increase with respect to Q4 2019 and 280% year on year. That would be very impressive, given the fact that AMD is considered to still be in their growth stage.

&#x200B;

**2021&2022 Outlook**

But the main thing to look out for is the guidance for the coming years. Given the continuing lockdowns, the fact that all the market segments they are in (consoles/PC’s/laptops/servers) are booming and the fact that they have GPU’s that can go head to head with NVDA’s I think they could raise their outlook for the coming year as well as 2022. Especially when the Xilinx merger goes trough and they have an increased TAM (total Accessible Market). Estimated EPS for the coming years are 1.83 and 2.42 but with all the mentioned tailwinds EPS targets of 2.00+ and 2.75 are not crazy. This would imply P/E’s off 34 for 2022 which is lower than ASML’s for example (50). Hence a stock price of 105-115 is a fair target in the short term and 137,50-145 as a long-term target.

&#x200B;

**Booming Market**

Finally, we have been in the biggest bull market in a long time, mainly driven by central bank money. Biden is planning a 2.8T stimulus package in the coming weeks. The rising tide has lifted all boats, leading to insane PE valuations across the markets (Lemonade trading at 150x FORWARD P/E for example). A forward PE of 34 for AMD is a way better bet in my opinion.

1029,Let this Buffet quote guide you with your decision on $SNOW,946,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/itv4t4/let_this_buffet_quote_guide_you_with_your/,491,"Snowflake (SNOW) will go public today. The data warehousing company will be the biggest IPO of the year and it has gotten a lot of attention lately. Salesforce and even Berkshire Hathaway will both be buying 3.1 million stocks, good for $500,000,000 in total. They got to buy them for $80 per share.

This week, the company's underwriters have upped the price range from $75-$85 to $100-$110, which is an increase of 31% due to greater demand. They then decided that this was still not good enough so the stock will go public at $120 per share.They reportedly increased share price to $180 just an hour before trading.

Can this be justified? Maybe. Their revenue increased with 130% in the first half of the year yoy. They're on track to bring in $500 mln in revenue this year. We all know that investors get really excited by cloud companies and pay a hefty premium for them, because they keep generating revenue during lockdowns and high growth rates are expected to continue over the coming years.

Now, here's the quote we've all been waiting for:

""For the investor, a too-high purchase price for the stock of an excellent company can undo the effects of a subsequent decade of favorable business developments.""

The irony is that Buffet himself is involved in this highly priced IPO. Yes, we all know that the company will probably do great over the next few years. The data warehousing industry will have a size of around $35 bln in 2025. That's just a little bigger than the current market cap of Snowflake($33.3 bln). Last February, they were only valued at $12.7 bln. Their PS-ratio would be around 100. What you really should be asking yourself is: how much of their expected growth is already priced in? Are you willing to pay 50% more than that institutional parties had to?

I'm not saying whether to buy in or not, I just wanted to give this piece of advice by the Oracle to you. Never buy out of FOMO and good luck investing y'all.

EDIT: Reuters reports that it will open at $235/share. That would put their market cap at $65 bln.

To add one of Buffet's quotes: ""IPO means It's Probably Overpriced""

&#x200B;

Baoshang Bank, a commercial bank with \~10k employees and over $61B total asset is facing severe credit risk and now being taken over by PBOC. This might the first bank run and bank bailout by PBOC after 1979 (Chinese economic reform)   

&#x200B;

I \*believe\* that there have been other bank ""failures"" in China, but instead of being publicly announced as a failure after a bank run, the shitty banks of the past were simply pulled into one of the state owned banks instead of this being so public.

&#x200B;

Not a huge bank by any means, but I find it interesting that they're being public with this instead of sweeping it under the rug. I wonder if this will be interpreted as a sign of weakness...

The stock market is often broken up into a few different categories that gives a general overall look at the economy. With the markets recent crash, the next few months will have some great buying opportunities for a lot of industries.

One of the easiest ways to invest is through ETFs. Below are some of the different industries that make up the entire economy. I have listed some ETFs that I believe are some of the best ones for each category. Check them out and let me know what other good ones I missed.

> BC was so keen to prevail that it even bid against itself in the auction, raising its own final offer by 50 cents -- to $83 per share -- before any opponent had matched the lower price, according to court records from a subsequent lawsuit. Apollo, the next highest bidder with an offer of $81.50, or about $150 million less, later told PetSmart’s investment bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co., that it ""never would have paid” what BC Partners did, a filing shows. JPMorgan declined to comment.

> BC Partners managed to pocket an immediate $800 million dividend, but it had a long road ahead. The acquisition marked its first-ever foray into the U.S. retail sector. And the new management team had no experience with the pet industry.

PetSmart’s financials deteriorated even more sharply as Chewy, which has yet to turn a profit, dragged on earnings.

But as Tesla’s U.S. sales approach those of luxury auto makers like BMW AG and Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, it has encountered new logistical problems, from delivery and servicing of a growing fleet to balancing supply and demand.

>Part of the problem is that Tesla, unlike other auto makers, doesn’t have a network of hundreds of franchise dealerships to sell and service its vehicles. Tesla has long touted this as an advantage, giving it more control over the customer experience. But it means Tesla has to pay for service centers and to staff them.

>Mr. Musk said Tesla has erred by storing service parts at distribution warehouses rather than more locally at service centers, noting a simple repair could take days waiting for parts to arrive.

>He also has said on Twitter that he wants to bring more collision work in-house. Body shops are a low-margin business and come with high costs to stock the proper equipment and hire trained staff.

Tldr: His cash position (actually t-bills) is not large compared to the entirety of Berk's assets. Now can you all stop with the ""But Buffett's holding cash"" meme?

""I show our net, our cash and Treasury bill position on March 31st. And you might look at that and say, “Well, you’ve got $125 billion or so in cash and Treasury bills. And you’ve got…” At least at that point, we had about, I don’t know, $180 billion or so in equities. And you can say, “Well, that’s a huge position to have in Treasury bills versus just $180 billion in equities.”
 
But we really have far more than that in equities because we own a lot of businesses. We own 100% of the stock of a great many businesses, which to us are very similar to the marketable stocks we own. We just don’t own them all. They don’t have a quote on them. But we have hundreds of billions of wholly owned businesses. So our $124 billion is not some 40% or so cash positions, it’s far less than that. 

And we will always keep plenty of cash on hand, and for any circumstances, with a 9/11 comes along, if the stock market is closed, as it was in World War I—it’s not going to be, but I didn’t think we were going to be having a pandemic when I watched that Creighton-Villanova game in January either.""

Just your daily reminder that **this is not the flu,** sars, ebola, or really anything else we've seen in our lifetimes. At the risk of beating a dead horse here.... this is not being priced into markets right now. At all. And at the risk of sounding alarmist, I am going to put my neck out there and say that this thing is the inevitable shock that always seems to kick off a recession (get your remind me's ready). With that said, it's going to take a little bit of time before markets digest the supply shocks that are going to come through from China's shutdown. And past that point, I really don't think anybody is pricing in the fact that this is going to start to mandate shutdowns elsewhere away from China as it spreads.

The funny thing, is that from a data perspective, we actually were starting to get a mild recovery in the macro regime, suggesting the Fed may have actually engineered a sort of soft landing, at least for a short bit. Given, that soft landing would have been heavily stimulus and debt fueled, but, the means don't matter in the short term, and that's often how things go anyway.  But this item is coming at a very very very bad time, and the economy just is not prepared to handle this even slightly. The markets obviously are not reflecting this right now for a variety of reasons, but markets aren't always the great discounters people would believe.

I will say, we likely will see some sort of massive wave of additional stimulus, or at least an attempt at it. But the transmission mechanisms of getting said stimulus to the people who need it is going to cause this to falter when it's needed most from my view.  


**Edit:** For those who don't understand the seriousness of this, here is a relevant quote from a highly respected authority - Mark Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at Harvard.

***""I think it is likely we'll see a global pandemic,"" said Mark Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""If a pandemic happens, 40% to 70% of people world wide are likely to be infected in the coming year. What proportion of those will be symptomatic, I can't give a good number.""***

He comments on this directly at: [https://twitter.com/mlipsitch/status/1228373884027592704](https://twitter.com/mlipsitch/status/1228373884027592704)

So look, is there a chance this will blow over? Sure. 100%, and I'm not an epidemiologist. But when leading epidemiologists collectively view this as being more likely to be a pandemic, yet markets are completely brushing this news off, I view that there is nothing being priced in here at all except perhaps stimulus. Even if there was only a 5% chance of the above scenario happening, I would expect markets to price in some of the massive risk that would be associated with this scenario, but that's not happening.",2020-02-14 17:17:10

# I'm also working on an Excel file which will provide all fundamental data about a stock, more info about that on my account. TLDR at bottom!

**Introduction**

With the change and progressing to extremer climates, global warming is coming our way. It has been shown world governments are incapable of properly taking action against this threat. Since it seems like global warming won’t be stopped, we will have to start adapting to the new extreme climates. One way of ensuring a comfortable living/working space in this grim future is by making use of HVAC (Heating Ventilation & Air Conditioning). **And that’s what got me thinking**. My family has been hell bent on **NOT** getting air-conditioning. But with the summer temperatures ever more frequently reaching +40c with a humidity of +70%(Hup Holland Hup) it’s becoming unbearable. Sleepless nights, overheated pets, fainting, old people dying and just losing your will to live. These are all issues more people around the world are starting to face. Every place on earth is getting more extreme. Every place on earth is getting more need for Climate control. And every company is looking to profit of that! This is why my next play is in the HVAC industry. 

**Finding our compatible companies.** 

I only want to invest in the best companies. Living in The Netherlands I personally don’t know the best brands, luckily, I’ve got great internet. So, after spitting through some review sites these are the 5 public companies that came out best when looking for “Best HVAC/Air-conditioning companies/brands”. (Not ranked) 

1. Carrier (Day&Night, Bryant, Toshiba & 15 more)

2. Trane (American Standard, Thermo King & 7 more). 

3. Daikin (Goodman, Amana). 

4. Lennox (Service Experts, Allies Air Enterprises). 

5. Johnson Controls (Hitachi, York)

**Understanding the HVAC market.**

Before we continue to further analyze the companies, we first need to understand the HVAC market.

Some facts: 

1. The HVAC business has been valued at $91.30B in 2020 and is expected to reach $173B by 2024 and $367B by 2030. That’s a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of +/-15%. 

2. The most popular countries for Air Conditioning (AC) per household are: Japan 91%, USA 90%, Korea 86%, Saudi Arabia 53%, China 60%. 

3. Global stock of AC is expected to grow to 5.6B by 2050, up from 1.6B in 2018. (This is 1 AC sold every second for the next 30 years).

4. Less than a third of the global households own an AC.

5. 8% of the 2.8B people living in the hottest parts of the world own an AC (Brazil, Indonesia, India, African countries).

6. AC demand is increasing every year going from 97,60M in 2012, up 111M in 2018.

As can been seen in the above statements the HVAC business is very well integrated in some large countries. But the most exciting prospects are those of the developing countries. In Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa and India only 16%, 16%, 9%, 6% and 5% respectively of the households have AC. This is a MASSIVE market just waiting to be exploited.

\- The Indian AC market stood at $4,3B in 2017 and is expected to surpass 11B by 2023, that’s a CAGR of over 17%. This rising growth is led by rising infrastructure development, growing demand for housing and the constantly rising temperatures and consumers purchasing power.

\- The Middle Eastern and African market is expected to have an CAGR of 4,9% during 2019-2024.

\- The Indonesian market is currently experiencing a 2% CAGR in AC demand over 2012 till 2018.

\- The US is expected to have a CAGR of 3.1% from 2020 to 2030.

\- Europe is expected to have a CAGR of 6% from 2019 to 2025.

\- **The global HVAC market is expected to grow with a CAGR of 5.5% from 2018 till 2024**.

**Market share.**

This was actually really really difficult to find free sources on and I can’t really make a clear picture out of it so here are the numbers:

\- 2013 North America market: Carrier 17%, Daikin 15%, Trane 10%, Johnson 9%, Lennox 6%, LG 5%.

\- 2013 Global AC market: Daikin 13%, Carrier 10%, Johnson 8%, Trane/LG 4%.

\- 2018 Indian market share: LG 17,7%, Hitachi 7,9%, Daikin 7,4%.

\- HVAC Used by construction firms in USA: Carrier 29%, Lennox 17,3%, Daikin 8,2%, Trane7,3%, LG 1,8% Johnson 1,8%.

\- 2020 global “Wall-Mounted Fan Coil Units” market: Daikin 29%, Trane 26%, Carrier 12%, Johnson 7,5%

My conclusion from this and other information found online is that globally Daikin is the biggest followed by Carrier, Johnson, Trane, LG and Lennox. I accounted for all known acquisitions since 2013 in the market share.

**Conclusion**

First of all, I should start with saying that Lennox really shouldn’t have been included, they are on a completely different level than these 4 other companies. Also, Johnson had some fuckery going on in all their 10k’s so these numbers might not add up, let me know if you found something.

Looking at the company’s financials and numbers it’s a tough decision to make, all companies a pretty close to each other. There are however some things that stand out:

\- Carrier has a significantly higher NPM then the competitors.

\- Lennox might be in financial trouble.

\- Daikin spends the most on R&D relative to its revenue, I see this as a big plus.

\- Johnson their revenue is growing the fastest on a 5Y CAGR.

\- Johnson their P/E is much higher than the competition.

\- Johnson their Dividend is the higher % wise

\- Daikin has increased sales in 2020 while other companies have seen a drop.

\- Daikin’s NPM is stable at around 8% while Carrier’s NPM has grown explosively. 

\- Trane has a high debt/equity ratio

\- Both Carrier and Daikin have a very strong Interest coverage ratio.

\- Johnson's TTM would be better without an irregular expense of 602M

Now on to the less financial aspect of the data.

I really like the way Daikin presents their annual report, they have clear strategies on how to better engage the Indian market. They are also showing that they know where their market growth protentional lays and are willing to act on it. Furthermore, what really strikes me as interesting is that Daikin produces materials for semiconductor testing, this might be a goldmine in the upcoming tech revolution and Daikin has shown to be well aware of this upcoming trend. Carrier on the other hand has not properly breached the Asian/Middle eastern market yet, they have stated to expand their geographical presence but I have found no conclusive strategies in how to do so. What is impressive about carrier is their high net profit margin and willingness to act on a more digital environment, an area where Daikin is currently lacking.

To conclude this research properly, if I had to choose a company right now, I’d being going for Daikin. Their well-presented data and goals for emerging markets, combined with their semiconductor products make me believe they are most suited for rapid growth. Their geographical location also puts them in a better position for Asian dominance. And their Goodman sub brand is well known in America and a direct competitor to Carrier. Carrier is a close second, with impressive brand recognition and attractive financials. One thing carrier does well that Daikin does not is transport refrigeration. In my opinion trucking is going to play a much larger role when self-driving trucks start to appear.",2020-10-26 07:28:12

It is now widely expected the bill, known as AB5, will pass a full Senate vote before the legislative session ends Sept. 13 and be signed by governor Gavin Newsom. The bill would likely force many gig companies to reclassify their independent contractors as employees, pulling the very foundation of the gig economy out from under it.

&#x200B;

My bull case for bitcoin:

Current New BTC ""minted"" = 1800 BTC/day

Net USD inflows to BTC to maintain price @ $4700/btc = 1800 \* 4700 = \~$8.5 million USD per day

Total USD inflows required to maintain price @ $4700 for the next 417 days until the halvening = $3.5 billion USD total

&#x200B;

At next ""supply halvening"", BTC minted falls 50%:

New BTC ""minted"" after May 20th 2020 = 900 /day

&#x200B;

Therefore if there is just $3.5 billion new investment in the next 417 days, price will be maintained at the current level until the halvening, at which time the huge supply shock will send the price shooting up at the same inflows. For comparison's sake, $5.5 billion of Lyft stock traded in the first DAY of their listing.

I'm completely shocked that holding a T-Bond to maturity beat the S&P over any period not starting when Volker hit the brakes.

1088,Amazon reveals a new plan to deliver more packages: Recruit people to run small-scale delivery services,900,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/8ujdtp/amazon_reveals_a_new_plan_to_deliver_more/,221,"Watch out [FedEx](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FDX), [UPS](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=UPS), DHL and the U.S. Postal Service: [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN) is building its own last-mile delivery service.

The e-commerce behemoth announced on  Thursday its new Delivery Service Partners program — designed to let  entrepreneurs run their own local delivery networks of up to 40 vans  emblazoned with Prime logos.

Each delivery unit will  start their day at one of 75 current Amazon stations in the U.S. where  parcels ordered from Amazon.com are picked up by drivers wearing  blue-collared shirts with an Amazon logo and black hats. Algorithms will  determine which packages are sent to these delivery stations, and which  are sent to other delivery partners, like FedEx and UPS.

""This is all about scaling cost  effectively,” said Dave Clark, senior vice president of Amazon Worldwide  Operations. He said the new delivery program will help meet the growth  in e-commerce. “We are going to have to meet this growth, and it's  outpacing the growth of our core providers.”

This year, more than 40 percent of all e-commerce purchases will be made on Amazon, according to an eMarketer estimate.

Clark said Amazon has  “great relationships” with its external delivery partners. “We use  everything in order to meet our scale and meet our needs. I don’t see  that changing in the future,” he said.

In its latest annual 10-K  filing, Amazon noted the risk associated with relying on external  partners like FedEx and UPS. “If we are unable to negotiate acceptable  terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or  other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results and  customer experience.”

In the filing, Amazon  said shipping costs — including sorting, delivery center and  transportation expenses — ballooned from $11.5 billion in 2015 to $21.7  billion in 2017, and its shipping costs are expected to continue to  increase.

The new program brings  more of the costs and customer service under its control, while letting  entrepreneurs run the operations under the behemoth’s name.

The e-commerce giant said  the program will enable “hundreds” of small businesses to get started,  and it will ultimately hire “tens of thousands” of new delivery drivers  across the country. This comes at a time when there is a trucker  shortage in the U.S., adding to rising transportation costs for many  businesses.

Amazon isn't providing an  estimate for how many or how long it will take to get more delivery  stations built in order to get packages to these new 10s of thousands of  delivery drivers.

Each Delivery Service  Partner can start a business with as little as a $10,000 investment. The  partner is vetted by Amazon, and once accepted, will lease  Prime-branded vehicles from Amazon, but the entrepreneur will be in  charge of recruiting and hiring drivers. Amazon will offer discounts for  costs incurred to run the business on expenses like fuel, insurance and  benefit programs. The company says the program is set up so successful  delivery partners can make up to $300,000 in annual profit.

Olaoluwa Abimbola has  been running his delivery service business in the Denver area as part of  the beta test for the last five months. While his background is in  computer science and not logistics, he says he’s “loving” his new  business and has already hired more than 40 employees who work “fairly  regular hours” and “are encouraged to take breaks.”

This new last-mile  delivery program is in addition to Amazon Flex, a delivery program in  more than 50 U.S. cities that operates more like Uber or Lyft, with “gig  workers” delivering parcels from their own vehicles for $18 to $25 an  hour.

Amazon’s Delivery Service  Partners is just another part of the company’s own logistics network.  It already has 7,000 of its own trucks and 40 airplanes which, along  with external delivery partners, shipped more than 5 billion Prime items  last year.

While Amazon won’t  disclose the financials behind the new program, Clark says it’s “much  more about customer experience and meeting overall growth. We think this  is going to be a cost effective way to do that.”

ABSTRACT: By employing leverage to gain more exposure to stocks when young, individuals can achieve better diversification across time. Using stock data going back to 1871, we show that buying stock on margin when young combined with more conservative investments when older stochastically dominates standard investment strategies?both traditional life-cycle investments and 100%-stock investments. The expected retirement wealth is 90% higher compared to life-cycle funds and 19% higher compared to 100% stock investments. The expected gain would allow workers to retire almost six years earlier or extend their standard of living during retirement by 27 years.

Meanwhile, Data analytics firm YipitData reported a similar trend, with the company telling Yahoo Finance that Netflix’s U.S. churn “rose materially” last weekend in the wake of the controversy. As of last Saturday, disconnects were running at nearly 8x the daily levels observed in August — a multi-year high, YipitData added.

Still, despite the downbeat data, the cancellations should not have much of a lasting impact on Netflix’s overall subscriber base. The platform has well over 182 million users worldwide and is the clear leader in the competitive streaming space — regardless of its recent controversies.

This IS The Market Crash: My DD.,7701,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ipp3e9/dont_be_fooled_this_is_the_market_crash_my_dd/,1678,"I've been researching this a LOT lately because I didn't want to get caught in it. Looking at trends and past data. I believe, strongly, that we're in the middle of the market crash. I used my knowledge and was able to fully exit my entire $500k portfolio on Tuesday, maintaining all my gains. I've even taken a sizeable position in SPY puts ($50k worth of Dec $260). I got my close friends out (well the ones who listened) on Friday at the first sign of positive movement.

First of all, a little history lesson on the [Minksy Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsky_moment#/media/File:Stylized_Minsky_Cycle.PNG). It's basically a theory for how market bubbles happen. It occurs in 5 steps. I will outline what they are in basic and how the current market looks in relation.

1. **Displacement**: This is the beginning of a new paradigm where the market changes in a big way. For this, that was the Coronavirus. This took place between February to April.
2. **Boom**: Increase in spending begins and major gains start to be made. Media attention and market involvement begin to increase. Currently, we've seen a HUGE increase in retail traders (who are extremely volatile) and massive media attention toward the stock market as it relates to corona news as well as stimulus and recovery speed gains. This took place between April and July.
3. **Euphoria**: People stop caring about any sort of reasonable investment strategy and just start throwing money at stuff. Tesla is a fantastic example of this, but many other stocks in the tech sector are guilty of this. July was the beginning of this phase as Tesla saw insane growth within a few week period and other companies followed suit very quickly. This continued into late August with Apple and Tesla going to stupid prices after their splits, and all the other big tech names reaching wild valuations.
4. **Profit Taking**: Smart money starts withdrawing funds from the market as they prepare for the crash. We are seeing [record insider selling](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/17/investing/insider-selling-stocks-market/index.html), but most publicly, it began with Tesla announcing they would sell $5bn in [new shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/01/tesla-to-sell-up-to-5-billion-in-stock-amid-rally.html). Their second biggest shareholder then announced they were conveniently ""[rebalancing](https://fortune.com/2020/09/04/tesla-stock-rally-investors-selling-outlook/)"" their portfolio to sell many Tesla shares as well. This was nothing more than a ploy to pull money out without crashing the market, even though it did anyway. I will get more in depth on this phase later. The biggest catalyst was [Softbank](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-dives-6-u-tech-004748400.html), though, and that leads me to the final stage.
5. **Panic Selling**: This is when people start to exit en masse in order to recoup whatever they can. We are currently witnessing this. The last few days have been a trainwreck on the market, wiping out August's gains entirely.

Now I know you want to say ""well look at today. We're up 2% in the S&P!"" This is par for the course on a crash. With the Corona crash, these were the rough day to day movement patterns (I'm using Corona as an example for its shortness/simplicity but all crashes have similar patterns):

* 1 small loss day 
* 2 BIG loss days 
* 3 medium loss days 
* 5 ***gain days*** (there were 5 days of gains in the middle of the March crash) 
* 1 GIANT loss day 
* 3 Sideways days 
* 8 slightly down days, leading to the bottom 

Of those gain days, the first was a slowdown, but the second was a change of 4.8% in S&P/SPY from an open of 294 to a close of 309. Consecutive, positive days occurred during every major crash. We can see that being mirrored today and will likely see more upward mobility before more big money starts exiting. Don't be fooled by positive days. That does NOT indicate the crash is over. Novices tend to think crashes are a short event and that they should hold through them because they missed the boat. Crashes take weeks, minimum, but **usually months, if not years**, to become fully realized. Covid's crash is the fastest we've had at one month.

Another trend I've noticed is that these market bubbles are happening and recovering faster and faster. The late 80's Japanese market crash took 6 years to play out. The 2000 dotcom bubble was 4 years. The Chinese 2007 bubble took 2 years. The 2008 oil bubble took 1 year. On the flipside, the 2007 housing bubble took 5 years. The 2008 energy bubble took 3 years. We're about 6 months into this current bubble, but more if you account for any forming bubble from before covid. Maybe this means nothing, but I thought it was worth mentioning.

Bubble analysts always say there is a warning sign prior to a true collapse. I've been seeing these called ""violent shake-offs."" Most crashes get one, but some get two. We had one with the June mini-crash. One could argue that this current crash could be a violent shake-off. I'll get to the alternate scenario later. Assuming it's not, which I don't think it is, we move to the final trigger, the catalyst.

**Catalysts**: These are are things required to trigger a bubble collapse. Almost every bubble has had some notable catalyst(s) to trigger the rapid decline. As mentioned in Profit Taking, we've had three catalysts occur so far that triggered panic selling. New Tesla shares, secondary Tesla offloading, and Softbank. They are the big one and who I will focus on for a minute.

To those who don't know, Softbank bought $4 billion in options during the early days of the market post-covid. These options are worth a fortune right now ($30bn estimated), but they have to be sold in order to be fully capitalized on. What everyone is afraid of is Softbank doing just that, or worse, for shareholders: holding through a market crash and losing it all. In the movie, Margin Call (great movie), a hedge fund got wind of the housing market crash before everyone else and ultimately sold EVERYTHING they had in order to get ahead of it, single handedly beginning the inevitable market crash. To be fair, this is a fictional movie and they had a portfolio of like a trillion, but it's really just mentioned to illustrate my point. Softbank has to exercise these options, which have strike prices likely WAY below market value. If they sell those shares, they could easily double their investment, even through a crash. The problem is that people got so spooked by this revelation that Softbank lost over $15 billion in market cap (currently at $112bn). Had this not happened, the speed at which we decline would've been much slower. They have to make those losses up now. You know what would do that? Exercising all their options and selling them for market gains.

They can't keep those options forever, either. At best they have 2 years. Softbank will try very hard to sell all those off without crashing the market, but if it keeps dipping, they will become more desperate and start selling them more frantically, promoting a panic selling cycle. And what are we in? A panic selling cycle.

If this cycle continues with Softbank, more will tack on and we'll see this bubble continue to collapse. If it can hold a recovery this week, it might survive, but of course, I don't think it will. The end of day today really showed that people *are* afraid and that given any opportunity, selloff will occur. I think this IS the crash. But, I could be wrong. That brings me to the second and third catalysts.

**Commercial Real Estate Crash**: The eviction crisis is a real threat to our economy. It's brushed under the rug pretty heavily, pointing to the home real estate market and its gains, but the damage is done. Most major commercial real estate buildings, especially apartments, are in disarray. Go look around and see the kinds of deals your local apartments are offering. Where I am, I'm seeing up to 2 months of free rent in some places. I've never seen that before. Everyone is desperate for paying tenants. Most commercial properties can weather a bit of this kind of thing, but we haven't seen anything like this. Small businesses are shutting down, new businesses are not opening. No one is shopping. Who replaces those lost tenants? All these properties are heavily in debt. That's how the industry works, for the most part. Entrepreneurs and builders finance all projects because they are seen as very safe and it's a rule of thumb to never use your own money for investment. The margins had become abysmal before corona. I once looked into buying commercial real estate and found that I would only cover the expenses and have to solely rely on the property value increasing, to make anything worthwhile. This will cause properties to bleed out extremely fast. There is a commercial real estate collapse coming, likely within 6 months, and it will compound any damage the tech bubble has done. Don't forget that this isn't strictly a US problem. This is a worldwide problem.

**Vacation Industry Crash:** Many countries around the world rely on a steady influx of visitors in order to keep their businesses afloat. This, in turn, boosts GDP. Malaysia, for instance, is a place I personally visited, during Covid, and it was a desolate wasteland. Most shops had employees literally standing outside waiting for a single customer. It was like this for blocks and blocks. Huge tourist attractions were completely devoid of people. It's only a matter of time before our lack of flying catches up to these already poor and extremely hard to maintain businesses. The country in Malaysia I visited had a notoriously low success rate for new restaurants, during the best of times. Now, they are lucky to get any customers. That affect will bleed into the second catalyst. More businesses going under, causing commercial real estate to lose tenants with no one to replace them, causing those buildings to go under, causing banks to be stuck with a boat load of vacant, unprofitable properties, causing them to go under.

Even with a vaccine, we won't go back to normal fast enough to recover the losses. The airline industry is reporting that they don't estimate returns to normal until late 2021, early 2022. Do you think a random Joe has enough liquidity to keep his business running that long at extreme drought? The people at the bottom of the chain, consumers and small business owners, were never prepared to have a cash supply on hand for this kind of hit to their lives. That *is* going to trickle up to the top and when it does, goodbye market.

Of course, there's also the US election, but that will be a small catalyst as far as I'm concerned.

\------------------------------------------------

Other notable indicators/insights that things don't look good:

1. Market cap to GDP was 2:1 at peak. The dotcom crash was 1.4 and the recession was 1.1. Currently 1.77:1.
2. Google trend results for ""Market Crash"" are trending up. Last week, which only accounted for 3 days, really, already topped the June mini-crash.
3. An [analyst](https://www.ft.com/content/9d12ae03-2f6b-4028-8464-e305269e7ee3) who witnessed the Japanese crash of the 1980's believes this will be the biggest crash we've ever seen.
4. EVs are the new dotcom company. Many will fail as car creation proves to be more difficult than anticipated.
5. High growth, high revenue companies do not automatically equate to sustainable companies, despite stock prices pretending they do. For example, Sea Ltd. doubled revenue but also doubled expenses in Q2 2020. eToys is a prime example of this, from the dotcom bust era. Had huge revenue, but their expenses could not be lowered to a sustainable level and went out of business, despite the business model making sense and the revenue stream looking really good.
6. The PE ratio of the market is above 30, which has historically always resulted in a market crash.
7. Apple saw 12 million shares exited at the bell today. Prior to that was around 600k peak. This happened for MOST tech stocks.
8. If you bought Microsoft at peak dotcom bust, you would have to wait 10 years to breakeven (longer if you account for inflation losses). That kind of stagnation is what we're looking at, even today.

\------------------------------------------------

This does NOT mean the entire market will crash. Quite the contrary. Yes, most stocks will go down as the market collapses in overvalued sectors (TECH) brings down the whole thing, but they will stay high if priced fairly. Most epicenter is priced within a reasonable area, for instance, and will weather the storm quite well. At least, until the commercial real estate market collapse catches up to them.

Plan accordingly, set stop losses, and do your own research. I don't expect you to just follow my information blindly. I may have gotten things wrong or mixed some wires. You need to figure this out on your own and make your own judgement call. I simply hope to raise awareness for what I believe is a market crash so that people don't lose their shirt during this. I hope I'm wrong, though I'm literally betting with my money that I'm not.

I was on a steady downtrend for the first 2 months (while the general market is on a steady uptrend) and found my account balance to be below $850. I had to take a break at this point and had serious thoughts about giving up. I thought I wasn't cut out to be a trader; I must be a part of the 95% who fail.  I decided to give it one more shot. I took a deep analytical dive into my past trades. I reevaluated my strategy, and found what was working and what wasn't. I slowly started seeing results. I clawed my way back to the original $1000 investment and today have officially hit the $100 profit mark.

I knew a lot of people would say that based on my story, trading probably isn't for me, you have a very valid reason for saying so, and you could still be right. I've heard that everyone's trading journey is different, and I'm hoping my journey can continue for much longer. Instead of thinking about how I've only made 10% in 8 months in one of the strongest bull runs, I like to think that I've gone from $850 to $1100 (30% gain) while the SPY has gone up 8% in the past two months.  I hope these type of gains can continue, but time will tell. Even if I can't continue these gains, I've really enjoyed the learning process and think that the knowledge I've gained is beneficial and worth the time to me.

1109,GME Infinite Gamma Squeeze | Gap In Option Market Structure | Once In a Lifetime Opportunity,6017,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l3e54f/gme_infinite_gamma_squeeze_gap_in_option_market/,2701,"# Context

What happened last week with GME stock price and option was a combination of a gamma squeeze \[1\] and infinite short squeeze \[2\]. For the first time in financial history all GME call options are in the money (ITM) because the highest call strike price set by the CBOE for Januaray 29, 2021 is $60.

**Note:** A primer on gamma squeeze:

h[ttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme\_i\_think\_this\_is\_a\_gamma\_squeeze\_where\_dealers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/)

Market Maker \[1\] are in a condition never observed in financial history. Hundred of thousands of retail (wsb) are buying the GME 60C across the options calendar and MM can't hedge properly because there are not enough GME shares to buy to properly financially hedge (accounting for the interest rate to borrow)

# Market Structure

To summarize the market structure:

1. Few GME shares to hedge.
2. Hundreds of thousands of (wsb) are buying the GME 60C because of the infinite short squeeze.
3. January 29, 2021 60C call option are the highest one on the option change for that date.
4. Conditions for Infinite Gamma Squeeze & Infinite Short Squeeze

As you may now realize --(MM and brokers) hope you don't -- there is a gap in the market structure that leaves them (MM/Citadel) vulnerable to massive losses.

# Infinite Gamma Squeeze

***Should*** **million of retails (wsb) buy the Januray 29, 2021 60C weekly on Monday, this will create an infinite gamma squeeze because MM still can't properly hedge, and are forced to buy shares at whatever price to hedge. MM doing so, forces brokers to margin call the shorts caught in their infinite short squeeze. Both conditions are pro-cyclical and feed on each other in an infinite feedback loop** ***so long as more an more retails buy the GME 60C.***

There is a chance that MM can dump the shares they bought to hedged the gamma steepening and call buying \[1\]. However, doing so does not make them market neutral. It effectively turns MM into a hedge fund. SEC may allow them to get away from this momentarily.

**However, after the MM dump shares in an attempt to stop the infinite gamma squeeze they will be net short GME shares and unhedged/not market neutral.** If after the MM dump, retails continue to buy GME shares up to the $60 price, MM will be caught in a *exponentially worse gamma squeeze*, which should GME go pass 60C (gamma bump) on the week of January 25, it would turn into the one of biggest tail risk event for the MM/Citidal.

**tldr;**

**There is a gap in the market structure so that if millions of retails buy Januray 29 GME 60C on January 25 2021, there is a high probability of both an infinite gamma and short squeeze. This has never happened in financial history. And should millions of retail buy the January 29 GME60C 2021, the losses for MM but profits for retail will be massive. Retails could see 100000% return on their weekly GME Januray 29 call options at the highest strike price.**

**Edit1:** Apparently there may be higher call prices for the January 29 2021 option chains. Fundamentally, this analysis is still correct. Should millions of retail all choose a common higher call strike price to buy (higher than 60C), the gamma squeeze will be triggered when that prices is hit.

Example:

Should millions of retail buy the January 29 70C or January 29 75C, and the infinite short squeeze continues. If the GME 70C or 75C is hit, GME share price enters a gamma squeeze.

What the MM are hoping for are twofolds:

1. They scare retails to sell below $60. This alleviates the infinite gamma squeeze. Or;
2. Retails don't all buy the same call options. But given that wsb loves high risk, I hypothesize they will all choose the furthest OTM call options.

GME at 60 is the Maginot line next week. Should it go to 75, gamma and infinite short squeeze continues. Should it fall below it, MM have won a strategic victory.

**Edit2:**

For gamma squeeze, you look at the open interest (OI) and strike price. Should the share price get close to the price with a highest open interest, that's when the gamma steepening occurs as probability goes to 1. MM have to buy shares to remain neutral as the options are now ITM.

Shares of the video game company soared more than 50% to $101.01 at its high of the session shortly after the open. The stock was last up 35% to $87.80 when it was halted for volatility.

“The sudden, sharp surge in GameStop’s share price and valuation likely has been fueled by a short squeeze, given the high short interest, and, to a lesser degree, speculation by retail investors on forecasts for the new gaming cycle and the involvement of activist RC Ventures,” Telsey analyst Joseph Feldman said in the note on Monday.

GameStop, a brick-and-mortar video game retailer, has been a popular short target on Wall Street. In fact, more than 138% of its float shares had been borrowed and sold short, the single most shorted name in the U.S. stock market, according to FactSet citing the latest filings.",2021-01-26 01:49:55
1112,I built a program that spots buzzing stocks on Reddit and Twitter,5432,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kumtz1/i_built_a_program_that_spots_buzzing_stocks_on/,344,"Following my comment on this sub 3 days ago, many of you have been asking me to share the stock picks from this program I have built that scrapes Reddit and Twitter for emerging stocks. So far, the majority of the picks are small caps so I can't publish them here. However, I still wanted to share with you all the higher caps that were surfaced.

**Before I share the picks of this week with you below, please consider reading this crucial preamble. That should answer your questions and avoid misconceptions.**

* My program, built on Python, scans Reddit and Twitter and bubbles up stocks that just started generating conversations. So we’re not talking about the over discussed meme stocks like TSLA, PLTR, PLUG and such. We’re talking about the next ones.
* I’ve been beta testing and tweaking the tool for the past year and although, there is room for improvement, it has allowed me to spot and pick up stocks such as PLUG, PENN or NET really early (bought in respectively at $3, $10 and $20) solely based on the tool’s insights.

**Ok, now that this is clear for everyone, here’s how to interpret the stock picks.**

* The percentage increase (+%) is based on a WoW (week on week) analysis. That means I am comparing mentions of a stock/ticker from one week to the previous week. I also use MoM and YoY data to inform the picks (a stock might surface this week based on big news but it might have been mentioned over and over during the year, which means it wouldn’t be considered an “emerging stock” based on my model).
* The “Reasoning” I provide is based on a light research I do on my own before highlighting any of the program’s picks in order to understand why they’re generating conversation. If I find out that they are based on a PnD, I filter the stocks out. If I have any doubt, I filter them out too but will mention them at the bottom of the results so people can form their own opinions.

**Warning**: For those who are worried that this will only surface PnD penny stocks, I have taught my program how to flag picks that are highly correlated with terms associated with PnD schemes (“moon”, “pump”, “dump” etc.). I still have to add a level of human curation to the algorithmic results, doing my own DD on the stocks I highlight, but my goal is to have the program do all the work in the future so there isn’t any biases coming in.

**2nd Warning**: I am a programmer, not a financial analyst. My goal is to share with you the results my program provides, not recommend any buys.

**Enough said, here’s the (small) list!**

**Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT) +670%**

Market Cap: $6.5bn

Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, focuses on the discovery and development of RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy, and other genetic therapeutic modalities approaches for the treatment of rare diseases.

Reasoning: The stock tanked 51% on Friday due to mixed test results on a gene therapy targeting muscular dystrophy. Note that they have 43 different therapies in their pipeline and 1 received mixed results so far. ARKG owns SRPT and reacted to the news by buying +700k shares.

**Magna International (MGA) +436%**

Market Cap: $22.7bn

Magna International Inc. designs, engineers, and manufactures components, assemblies, systems, subsystems, and modules for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of vehicles and light trucks worldwide. Clients include Aston Martin, BMW, Ford, Daimler, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubish, Peugeot, Citroen, Renault, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo.

Reasoning: LG and Magna partnered to electrify powertrains last week. Rumors have now spread that Magna could potentially become the manufacturer of Apple’s new car.

Disclaimer: I do not currently own any shares in SRPT. I own shares in MGA.

Buffett's company earned $255 billion in revenue and booked $73 billion in investment gains last year, fueling $81 billion in net income. Moreover, it held $137 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of March — enough to buy Tesla in its entirety at the time, as its market value had tumbled below $100 billion during the coronavirus crash.

Meanwhile, Tesla had about 48,000 full-time workers last year, less than an eighth of Berkshire's workforce. It also generated about $25 billion in sales — a tenth of Berkshire's revenue — and posted a $900 million net loss. Musk's company also had only $6.6 billion in net assets last year, less than 1/60th of Berkshire's $425 billion.

IT TOOK ME A FEW HOURS TO MAKE THIS SPREADSHEET AND I WOULD LIKE TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE OPENING AND DUPLICATING THE SHEET, PLEASE HELP PAY IT FORWARD.**

Disclaimer: I originally created this tool for WSB, but it looks like I am muted there for some reason, so I figured I would share on some other subs where people are also talking about GME.

This whole experience has been (and will be) a crazy trip, but you don't want to be the one caught holding the bag when it eventually comes crashing down to earth. **HAVE AN EXIT STRATEGY.** Everyone has different levels of expendable capital and risk tolerance. Some of us can afford to YOLO away six-figure investments, while others would be more than happy to simply turn a few hundred dollars into a grand.

Your exit strategy should depend on how much money you are comfortable losing, and how much profits you would be happy taking. I'm not here to tell you what your strategy should be, but I did make a tool so you can figure it out for yourself: [Exit Strategy Calculator (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13twJC8Ldy3p7iS7fp5htOjfhTYZIE_Fqa5Rn9wgqv8c/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

**HOW TO USE THE EXIT STRATEGY PLANNER**

\- Note 1: **This is for shares only**. I'm not smart enough to make this work for options.

\- Note 2: The link I provided is READ ONLY, so the first step is to **make a copy** for your own use (File --> make a copy)

\- **Now, enter your current position.** Provide the number of shares you have in A3, and your average cost basis in B3 (these cells are highlighted in yellow). Your total investment will automatically calculate in C3.

\- **Columns E-F are the ROI calculator.** Column F tells you what the share price will need to reach in order to hit the ROI listed in Column E. Column G tells you what your total value would be at that share price.

\- **Columns I-K are your break-even analysis**, which basically tells you what the share price would need to be for you to break even by selling X number of your shares, and what your profit would be if you sold all of them at said price. *You will probably want to adjust the #s in Column I based on how many shares you currently have in your position*. Columns J & K will automatically update when you do.

\- **Columns M-N calculate your profits at different share prices.** How much money will you make if you sell when GME hits $80? What about $100, or $250, or even $1,000? These columns will tell you. Feel free to adjust the share prices in column M if you want, but I have most of the big milestones covered.

\- **Columns P-R are your exit strategy planner.** *You will need to provide the following information: # of shares (if any) you want to hold long term, post-squeeze \[cell P4\]. Maximum dollar amount from your initial investment that you can stomach losing \[Q4\]. Profit amount you would be 100% happy cashing out with no FOMO of future gains \[R3\].* Cell Q6 will calculate your ""worst case scenario"" sell price. **Set a stop loss order at this price to maximize your losses** to the amount you entered in Q4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares. Cell Q7 will calculate your ""best case scenario"" sell price. **Set a limit order at this price to cash out with your ""100% satisfied profit""** you entered in R4, while still holding your desired # of long-term shares.

\- **Columns T-V is an incremental sales planner.** Some of you may want to sell a portion of your shares when certain benchmarks are hit (ie sell 10 shares when it hits $100, another 10 at $150, etc.). Simply enter in how many shares you want to sell at each price point \[column U\], and the sheet will calculate your cumulative revenues, net profit, and remaining shares.

TLDR: Use this spreadsheet to avoid getting caught holding the bag on GME when all of the shorts are officially squeezed. Make a copy for yourself and change the cells highlighted in yellow to account for your personal position and risk/reward preferences.

Of course you can use this spreadsheet for your other investments, but let's be honest... half of us seem to be all in on GME right now. Big week ahead, may all of our profits be plentiful!

**EDIT:** A few people have mentioned that the file traffic was too high and it was not allowing them to make a copy. Fear not! I have made some alternate sheets you can use instead (they are all the same).

Diversification preserves wealth, concentration creates it. There’s nothing wrong with taking a higher percent stake in a company that you believe will outperform the broader market.

The money we made from TSLA helped us make a down payment on our first apartment, so it went to good use. 

Selling TSLA felt bitter sweet as I love this company, I have a man crush on Papa Musk and I was planning initially to hold my dear TSLA shares “forever”. However, I’m forever grateful to this company as it made buying an apartment possible for me. Believing in it paid off.

I believed in it when so many said I was crazy (or thought it). Elon is a true visionary and I truly believe TSLA is going to continue on its path to greatness.

Also, I wasn’t trying to time the top at all. It’s near impossible to do anyway. I just saw an opportunity, went with my gut feeling and seized it.

1124,"Trump to block U.S. downloads of TikTok, WeChat on Sunday",4220,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/iv56al/trump_to_block_us_downloads_of_tiktok_wechat_on/,1021,"The Commerce Department announced Friday morning that it would ban U.S. business transactions with Chinese-owned social apps WeChat and TikTok on Sunday.

The announcement comes ahead of an expected statement Friday by President Donald Trump on whether or not the government will approve a deal for Oracle to take a minority stake in TikTok and become a “trusted technology partner” for the company in the U.S.

It’s unclear if the Commerce Department’s announcement means there’s no possibility of a deal going through before the Sunday deadline, and it could be an aggressive move from the Trump Administration to push for its original intention for TikTok to be fully owned by a U.S. company.

“At the President’s direction, we have taken significant action to combat China’s malicious collection of American citizens’ personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations.” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement Friday.

Friday’s announcement from the Commerce Department is an enforcement of Trump’s original executive order from August 6 that gave TikTok 45 days to sell its U.S. business to a U.S. company or face a ban in the U.S. WeChat, which is one of the most popular social messaging apps in the world, is owned by the Chinese company Tencent. TikTok’s parent company is the Chinese company ByteDance. Trump’s executive order cited national security concerns over the Chinese government’s access to user data in those apps to justify the potential ban.

The Commerce Department’s statement on Friday said that starting Sept. 20, U.S. companies would be banned from distributing WeChat and TikTok, meaning the two major mobile app stores run by Apple and Google would have to remove the apps from their libraries. The statement also blocks U.S. companies from providing services through WeChat “for the purpose of transferring funds or processing payments within the U.S.”

WeChat is a popular marketing and sales tool for U.S. companies primarily in China, but around the world as well. With U.S. social apps like Facebook and Instagram banned in China, WeChat is the primary app people use for social networking and e-commerce. It’s also a popular app used by people in the U.S. to communicate with people in China, since U.S. apps are banned in China.

The Commerce Department’s announcement also lays out a separate time frame specific to TikTok, which take affect on Nov. 12. The rules that start Nov. 12 include provisions that block U.S. companies from providing internet hosting and services for TikTok. This could be directed at the deal being negotiated between TikTok and Oracle, which would provide cloud services for TikTok if Trump approves, and could give TikTok and Oracle more time to hammer out a deal that Trump will approve.

Representatives for Tencent, TikTok, WeChat, Apple and Google were not immediately available to comment.

1128,If you bought DoorDash at $180...,4060,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kagdre/if_you_bought_doordash_at_180/,957,"You're a complete and utter fool.  Let's take a look at the issues:

1) No moat at all.  Sure they have 50% market share but there are competitors.  They're a delivery service - anyone can do what they do.  Not only does this pose a risk to market share, but it poses a huge risk to the already thin profit margins.  At some point (because of 2-4 below) they will have to lower their fees and take rate, which will hurt margins even more.

2) No brand value or brand loyalty.  People couldn't care less who delivers their food, as long as it shows up on time and hot.  Early in COVID I was using Skipthedishes until I got frustrated with poor service so I left.  There is nothing to keep customers loyal to DoorDash if someone else offers better service, or the same service at a better price.

3) Restaurants hate them.  DoorDash takes a huge cut, which forces restaurants to raise their prices.  I posted an example yesterday about a sandwich I ordered that was $13.95 on the restaurant's online menu but $18.95 on the DoorDash menu.  Restaurants have been using them out of necessity but they are already finding ways around it.  Many restaurants offer customers incentives for picking up their food.  There are reports of restaurants grouping together and doing their own shared delivery.  There are even reports of enterprising people starting their own local delivery services at lower rates.

4) Future growth will plummet.  People have been using this service out of necessity but DoorDash doesn't provide a service that will permanently change the way people live.  People love eating in restaurants and will flock back to them as soon as it is safe/allowed to do so.  Do you really think that people are going to continue ordering in on weekends through an overpriced delivery service as soon as they can return to restaurants?

5) The CEO reportedly defended the IPO price by saying they priced it at a level they thought fairly reflected the value of the company.  That means the CEO thinks the company is worth \~$100/share.

This IPO was purely a case of ownership taking advantage of timing to raise as much cash as possible.  I wouldn't be surprised if this thing is trading at $30 a year from now.  This is going to be the FIT or GPRO of 2020 IPOs.",2020-12-11 01:40:10

1135,"Tesla is 'profoundly overvalued,' and its exclusion from the S&P 500 was a 'brave' decision by the index committee, DataTrek says",3867,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/iqebna/tesla_is_profoundly_overvalued_and_its_exclusion/,621,"Tesla's exclusion from the S&P 500 index on Friday was a surprise to many, given that the mega-cap electric-vehicle manufacturer ticked off all the eligibility requirements.

Tesla on Tuesday fell 21% from Friday's close as investors digested the S&P 500 exclusion amid a tech-heavy market sell-off.

But the S&P Dow Jones Indices index committee's decision to exclude Tesla despite its eligibility for inclusion was a ""brave"" one, DataTrek cofounder Nicholas Colas said in a note on Wednesday.

The decision by the committee could ""only have come from a collective and committed view that Tesla is profoundly overvalued,"" Colas said.

Tesla traded at a trailing 12-month price-earnings multiple of 913x on Wednesday, according to data from YCharts.com. The S&P 500 traded at a trailing 12-month price-earnings multiple of 21.7x, according to JPMorgan.

In addition to a steep valuation, the committee likely thinks Tesla ""sits on shakier fundamentals"" than its August 31 market capitalization of $465.2 billion may indicate, DataTrek said.

That might refer to the fact that much of the profit Tesla has recorded over the past few quarters derives from the sale of green EV regulatory credits to other carmakers that don't meet the mandated annual EV production quota, and not from Tesla's main business of building and selling cars and solar panels.

Tesla will remain eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500 index if it continues to stay profitable in future quarters.

Instead of Tesla, the committee added Etsy, Teradyne, and Catalent to the S&P 500 index.

1137,My 8 investing guidelines.,3843,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kehrkg/my_8_investing_guidelines/,315,"I've been investing, trading, gambling for about 5 years now and I've done pretty much every rookie mistake there is. Sold winners from 2016 (Shop,Nvidia,AMD,Paypal) Lost fortunes on chasing that pennystock. Played and lost with trying to time the market, option trading. 

&#x200B;

I've been very active during these years reading and learning and you be surprised how often people get sucked in to the same stuff you self did once. 

These are 8 guidelines that really helps me and that I've learn to appreciate over the years.

&#x200B;

**1.Don't FOMO**

Yes we all heard it. You know that feeling when people are posting crazy gains on these new stocks, we all saw the EV hype. It's so so easy to get sucked in to thinking, if I just put in some money right now I can get 10-20-50% gains in a few days! It's already up 200% this month, surely it will keep going!? 

This takes some real patience to keep your head cool and realize it could very well be overbought and the downside risk is just a lot higher than potential. 

&#x200B;

I've seen several sector hypes. We all remember the crypto bubble, the weed bubble and now lately the EV bubble. They all come and go and the more of these you been in from the start the easier it is to realize what's going on. 

&#x200B;

**2. Cut your losers and let your winners run**

Buying the dip is great when the market is down but if the fundamentals of the business is bad then usually this will just result in greater loss. On the flipside, if you have a few great picks and nothing fundamentally has changed and it keeps moving in the right direction then don't be afarid to keep adding.

&#x200B;

**3. When the overall market is down, you buy**

No one can predict the market, don't waste time on it. When the overall market is down your stock is literally on sale. Usually every sector is down when the market is down, your stock and business has not changed one bit however, it's just a lower price now. 

&#x200B;

**4. Don't be afraid of corrections.**

Yeah it sucks seeing your portfolio down 20-30-40% but realize that stocks always go up, they seriously always do. Just keep your head down, keep buying and play that long game.

**5. Small amounts can turn into big profits down the line**

When you get really into investing you seriously start rethinking your life. That new OLED 77 inch? Only 2k right? What do you think that 2000 could be in 10 years? You just want to put every damn penny you got in the stock market because compounding interests are just too good to pass up. So just rethink if really need that new thing now or if it could wait.

**6. If the company keeps growing, why sell?**

Taking profit is good however not always the best thing to do. If the stock you have keeps growing and keeps crushing earnings. Why should you sell? Why just not keep it for years, it sure can be tempting but are you sure that money could be spent better elsewhere when it's easily growing in your winning stock.

&#x200B;

**7, Never regret that you didn't buy more**

 We all been here. Why the hell didn't I buy more of Amazon? Why didn't I just put my whole paycheck in this stock!? 

You can never do this. It won't lead to anything, you can't fix it and you honestly did the best decisions at the time with the information you had. Realize that at the time this was the best decision, ofcourse hindsight it looks like you could have done a better decision.

&#x200B;

**8. Don't sell and buy in again to time a correction**

This is very hard and with the momentum some growth stocks have these days you might just end up loosing more of that profit even if there is a slight correction. Just keep the money in and stop worrying.",2020-12-17 07:56:16
1138,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,3742,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kz682f/i_created_an_algo_that_tracks_the_most_hyped/,385,"I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How is ""Hype"" calculated?**

Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

1139,Costco selling $17.5K private jet membership that lasts 1 year,3744,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ju6y7q/costco_selling_175k_private_jet_membership_that/,356,"If you’re worried about flying commercial because of the pandemic, Costco might be able to help you out -- you’ll just need $17,500.

The wholesale retailer sells a one-year membership to a private jet charter company called Wheels Up, which allows members to book a private jet “as easily as a ride share or short-term vacation rental,” the product description says.

Although the $17,499.99 membership is quite a hefty fee, it also comes with a $3,500 Costco Shop Card and $4,000 worth of flight credit.

Other benefits include “dedicated account management,” a one-year membership with Inspirato, a luxury vacation rental subscription service and “guaranteed nationwide aircraft availability up to 365 days a year,” according to the description.

Members can either buy an additional “Fund Program” with lower rates and lower billable fly times, or they can “pay as they fly,” according to the product description.

The Wheels Up fleet includes more than 300 private aircraft as well as more than 1,250 partner aircraft.

The company also promises enhanced health and safety measures through its “Safe Passage” program, which includes having all Wheels Up aircraft getting an anti-microbial shield treatment at least every 90 days and having all seats and interior surfaces sanitized between every flight, the website says.

The Wheels Up membership can be found online in the “Electronics” category, or in-store with other gift cards, according to The Washington Post.

I think this is a great sign along with Biden's appointment of Yellen as the Treasury Secretary.  The news brings a sense of stability in that there will be a smooth transition of power and Yellen apparently has a track record of focusing on economic growth as a true economist as opposed to giving into political leanings.

While I am not one to boldly predict how the markets will react the rest of this week and there is still uncertainty given the rise in cases and the lack of stimulus... at least there are fewer variables to worry about.

1145,Biden will move to implement his $2 trillion climate plan on day 1 to bolster the economy and kick off the new administration's fight against climate change,3494,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l0tiop/biden_will_move_to_implement_his_2_trillion/,607,"Climate change is at the top of President-elect Joe Biden's funding agenda once he assumes office on Wednesday, as the new administration looks to add jobs to the economy while combating the warming climate.

In his $1.7 trillion climate proposal, Biden plans on reversing many of President Donald Trump's actions that relate to the climate on his first day in office, such as **rejoining the Paris Agreement, ending the Keystone XL pipeline, and establishing rules that limit methane emissions from oil and gas drilling operations. The proposals are also intended to boost the still-struggling economy, and by confronting climate change, 10 million clean energy jobs could be created if the proposal is successful.**

""If executed strategically, our response to climate change can create more than 10 million well-paying jobs in the United States that will grow a stronger, more inclusive middle class enjoyed by communities across the country, not just in cities along the coasts,"" Biden's website states. 

The climate was also high up on the agenda during the confirmation hearing of Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen on Tuesday. **Yellen told lawmakers that Biden's infrastructure plan will involve investing in clean technology, renewable energy, promoting electric vehicle usage, and creating jobs.**

**""Climate change is a critical problem facing the country, and President-elect Biden is committed to a wide range of policies to address it,"" Yellen said at the hearing. ""And in the process, making sure that in doing that we create good jobs for American workers.""**

**Yellen also said that Biden is in ""full support"" of restoring full incentives for electric vehicles, along with ensuring workers have the skills to succeed in the electric vehicle industry.**

Democratic lawmakers support federal spending for combating climate change. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said in Yellen's hearing that he hopes to advance a bill that will prioritize clean energy, clean transportation and energy conservation - efforts that address the ""existential threat"" of the warming climate.

Given the partisan nature of climate proposals over recent years, whether Biden can carry out costly climate initiatives is uncertain, but Yellen remains clear that it will be a priority, and will benefit the economy through job creation.",2021-01-20 08:19:05

Palantir technologies is an American software company founded in 2003 and headquartered in Colorado that specializes in big data analytics.

They started building software for the intelligence community in the US to assist in counterterrorism investigations by helping them identify patterns hidden deep within large datasets.

Later they realized that similarly to the intelligence community, commercial institutions did not have the most effective tools to manage and make sense of the data involved in large projects.

Palantir has now developed two principal software platforms, Palantir Gotham which serves primarily the intelligence community, and Palantir Foundry for commercial purposes.

Palantir went public on September 30, 2020 through a direct public offering. The company opened for trading at $10 a share, giving it an initial valuation of about $22B. As of the date of this publishing, Palantir stock is trading at $25.98, with a Market Cap of $44.26B, and 52-w high of $33.50.

# Understanding the Business

**Value Proposition**

Institutions often rely on various single-purpose software solutions which support the specific workflows of their operations such as customer relationship management and financial planning. Each new software creates a new silo within an already fragmented data landscape.

When it comes to making operational decisions, institutions are left spending significant time and resources to unify their data. By the time the question is answered, the underlying data may be stale.

A central operating system for data

Palantir’s software allows institutions to reorganize the various independent data systems that support their operations into a unified data asset which facilitates advanced data analysis, knowledge management, and collaboration.

Augmenting existing data systems, not displacing

At a large manufacturer, Palantir does not build machine production ERP software, instead, Palantir’s software connects their production ERP data with other relevant systems. By integrating existing solutions into our central operating system, organizations can choose to maintain key historic investments without having to rebuild their entire data infrastructure.

Making data actionable

Gotham and Foundry enable their users to put data in context, using language that people understand. They transform data into objects that make sense to everyone in an organization. Data is represented not as cells in a spreadsheet, or exports from a single system, but as entities, events, relationships, consequences, and decisions.

Their ontology management systems allow organizations to create their own description of the world, starting from a set of basic components: objects (such as people or events), properties (attributes), and relationships that tie objects together.

Understand the history of data and decisions

Palantir’s software tracks each piece of data in the system to its source and records all changes that have been made to a dataset or data object. Users can distinguish between data derived from a source system or data created by another user, and if a dataset has been updated/modified, the user can also identify the fact that the data was updated, the action, and the logic used to perform the update. This allows users to easily explain where the data, logic, and decisions originate.

Enable users to work together even in the most complex circumstances

The versioning and branching capabilities of their software enables thousands of users across departments and organizations to work on the same datasets, and actively collaborate on new models and analysis.

Users can safely branch a view or a dataset into an isolated sandbox where the user is able to build or experiment as they wish and may merge successful experiments back into the main dataset. Each version of a dataset is saved so that it remains protected and available for concurrent access.

Enforce rigorous and reliable data protection

Palantir’s software was designed to embrace the complexity of security clearances, institutional boundaries, and varying data sensitivity levels. Organizations are able to secure each piece of information and define the privileges users require to perform a specific action on a specific resource. The central authorization system creates an audit trial of user activity which allows oversight officials to monitor behavior, identify potential violations, and investigate anomalies.

AI/ML and operational change through data-driven decisions

Their software infrastructure also enables organizations to combine simple math, third-party black box models, and machine trained models of the different components of their businesses in a graph made up of nodes (for example, each node can be a manufacturing unit and distribution site in a supply chain) where each model can describe the properties of a node, resulting in an interactive digital simulation of an entire supply chain.

The AI/ML interface surfaces critical information about models, including plots, validation statistics, model stages, parameters and metadata.

**Revenue Streams**

Palantir’s revenue streams consists of their two main software, Gotham which was designed primarily for the defense and intelligence sectors, and Foundry for the commercial sector. However, the platforms are not exclusive to either sector, for example, Gotham is also offered to commercial customers in the financial services industry. The two platforms can either be used separately or bundled together as a single ecosystem.

Currently, revenue is more or less evenly split between the government and commercial sector.

It is important to note that for the government sector Palantir has to participate through a procurement process against other contractors who also sell custom tools.

Gotham

Its main tools include:

Graph – a whiteboard like interface for users to explore, visualize, and interact with entities, their properties and their networks. Users can create or edit data in the graph and resolve duplicate objects to ensure robust data quality.

Gaia – lets users plan, execute, and report on operations via a shared live map. Live maps track real-time data and users drag and drop objects from other Gotham applications directly into Gaia.

Dossier – is a live collaboration document editor to share analysis and discover intelligence. Users can collaborate across teams and organizations to create a living, interactive, and up-to-date document.

Video – an application designed to interact with both streaming and historical video data. Users can review video footage in the platform as well as enhance raw footage with geospatial information and overlays based on other data sources.

Ava – an AI system which scans billions of data points in order to proactively assist investigations by alerting users to new, hard-to-find potential connections.

Mobile – brings Gotham into the field via mobile devices to provide support to real-time, distributed operations.

Foundry

Monocle – enables users to understand data lineage using a graphical interface. Users can explore upstream dependencies or downstream consumers of data, as well as trace logic for a dataset back to its source.

Contour – enables top down exploration of large-scale data. Users may filter, join, and visualize datasets to answer analytical questions and publish the results as a report or new dataset that will automatically update with the underlying datasets.

Object Explorer – allows users to interact with data represented as objects – like customers, equipment, or plants – rather than rows in a table.

Fusion – Foundry’s spreadsheet environment.

Reports – allows users to publish their work from other applications in a document that dynamically updates as the underlying data changes.

I strongly suggest watching [Palantir’s demo day](https://palantir.events/livedemoday) on January 26 to gain a better understanding of the tools provided by both software.

Palantir’s Software Example Use Cases

* Humanitarian workers plan disaster relief missions following a natural disaster.
* Investigators receive alerts about open cases when new data about a suspect enters any system.
* Automotive plant engineers detect defects at their station while vehicles are still on assembly line.
* District attorney map out complex criminal networks in order to decide where to focus resources.
* Scientists use a unified view of cancer patients to personalize care.

# Industry

**Market Size**

As of Q3 2020 Palantir had 132 customers across 36 industries around the world.

Currently, according to Palantir’s own estimates the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for their software across the commercial and government sectors around the world is approximately $119B. The TAM for the government sector is $63B and for the commercial sector $56B. Within the government TAM, $37B is international and $26B is domestic.

According to [Statista’s market forecast](https://www.statista.com/outlook/14000/100/software/worldwide) revenue in the software market is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of 7.4% between 2021 and 2025.

**Industry Fundamentals**

Embrace digital transformation or risk getting disrupted

It has become evident that companies which embrace digital transformation persist, while businesses that fail to transform or transform too late will disappear. According to a [Harvard Business Review report](https://hbr.org/sponsored/2017/07/digital-transformation-is-racing-ahead-and-no-industry-is-immune-2) digital disruption extinguished 52% of Fortune 500 companies between 2000 and 2017.

We have repeatedly seen that pathbreaking institutions that use data to transform their core operations are the ones that win.

Buy or Build

Institutions often resort to the default approach of attempting to build a custom solution themselves. However, according to a recent [report by The Standish Group](https://www.standishgroup.com/about), of 50,000 custom software projects from more than a 1,000 organizations, only 23% that were started from scratch were completed on time and on budget, while 56% of all projects were either overdue or over budget. Additionally, only 12% of organization-wide digital transformation projects were considered successful.

Additionally, according to the [NewVantage Partners 2020 Big Data and AI Executive Survey](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200106005280/en/NewVantage-Partners-Releases-2020-Big-Data-and-AI-Executive-Survey), business adoption of Big Data continues to be a struggle, with 73.4% of firms citing this as an ongoing challenge.

Palantir provides the example of a U.S. Military department which spent more than $1 billion building an enterprise resource planning system from scratch. The system was never delivered, and the project was terminated.

Crisis & Instability

A [survey from AppDynamics](https://www.appdynamics.com/blog/news/agents-of-transformation-report-2020/) reports that 71% of IT professionals said COVID-19 has caused their businesses to implement digital transformation projects within weeks rather than the typical months or years, and 65% of respondents said they implemented digital transformation projects during the pandemic that had been previously dismissed.

# Competitive Landscape & Risks

**Competition**

Palantir’s main competitors include:

Internal software development – At first, organizations frequently attempt to build their own data platforms with the help of consultants, IT services companies, packaged and open-source software, and sizable internal IT resources.

And two software companies with very similar business models:

[Alteryx](https://www.alteryx.com/) – founded 23 years ago and based in California, Alteryx is a public company with FY 2019 revenues of $418M and more than 1,290 employees. Alteryx is focused on providing solutions to the commercial sector and as of 2019 they had approximately 6,100 customers in more than 90 countries. Amongst their main customers are Chevron Corporation, Federal National Mortgage Association, Nasdaq Inc, Netflix, salesforce.com, Toyota, Twitter, and Uber Technologies.

[Semantic AI](https://www.semantic-ai.com/company) – is a privately-held software firm based in California, Semantic AI was founded in 2001 and after 9/11 it was used as “platform by choice” by the intelligence community. Similar to Palantir, they have gained significant adoption in the Defense and Law Enforcement communities and have recently launched their enterprise intelligence platform.

**Competitive Strategy**

Customer acquisition

Palantir’s customer acquisition strategy targets large-scale, hard-to-execute opportunities at large government and commercial institutions. The high installation costs, high failure risks, complexity of data environments, and the long sales cycle associated with these opportunities raise the barriers to entry for competition.

Additionally, in the first phase of Palantir’s customer acquisition strategy, they provide minimal risk to their customers through short-term pilot deployments of their software at no or low cost to them. As the customer increases the usage of the platform across its operations, Palantir’s revenue and margins grow significantly.

Software engineers on the front line

In order to fully address the most complex challenges of their customers, Palantir sends their Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs), in order to experience and understand the problem firsthand. By working alongside their customers, FDEs gain a deep understanding of their needs, how and why they make decisions, and how they calculate trade-offs.

Leverage experience in both private and public sector

To the commercial sector, Palantir offers software which was designed to be secure enough to handle national secrets and stable enough to support soldiers’ wartime decisions. To the government sector, they offer software which incorporates and reflects Palantir’s experience of working across 36 industries and years spent in the field.

Palantir’s strategic relationships last for years

By the end of 2019, Palantir’s top 20 customers had an average relationship of 6.6 years.

Palantir has chosen sides

Their software is exclusively available to the United States and its allies in Europe and around the world.

**Growth Strategy**

Become the industry default

Palantir’s current and potential customers are some of the largest enterprise in the world. They intend to broaden the platform’s reach through partnerships that establish their platforms as the central operating system for entire industries.

This model has been successfully implemented in the aviation industry where, through its partnership with Airbus, work with more than a 100 airlines and 15 airline suppliers.

Continue to grow their direct sales force

Palantir’s decision to grow their sales force in recent years has resulted in a number of significant new customers, including Fortune 100 companies as well as a number of leading government agencies in the U.S. and other countries.

Increase their reach with existing customers

To drive revenue growth at an account, Palantir uses a number of sales and marketing strategies which include:

* Creating partnerships to extend the platform beyond the customer’s four walls into the operations of their partners and suppliers
* Selling additional productized cross-industry software capabilities
* Selling strategic implementations of Palantir’s software against specific use cases

For Q3 2020 Palantir’s average revenue per customer had increased 38% compared to the same period last year.

Become the default operating system for the U.S. government

Palantir’s software has been tested and improved over years of use across industries and various government agencies in the U.S. who have been able to deploy Palantir’s platforms rapidly with minor configurations.

Palantir already works with government agencies such as the U.S. Army, Navy, and Airforce, CDC, Department of Homeland Security, FDA, and SEC.

New methods of customer acquisition and partnership

As Palantir considers growing into new markets outside the U.S., they may consider entering into partnerships with strategic organizations that operate in their target market.

For example, in Japan they launched a partnership with SOMPO Holdings, Inc.. one of the largest insurance companies in the country, to help grow their commercial and government business in the Japanese market.

**Moats**

R&D expenditure

Since 2008 and up to 2019, they have invested a total of $1.5B in research and development.

Network effects

Every data source that is integrated to the system, and every action taken by a developer, data scientist, or operational user, is made accessible to all other users at the institution.

At a financial services customer, network effects enabled Palantir’s software to scale from a single use case to more than 70 workstreams across compliance, front office, risk, and internal audit desks. Each new application was built on a shared foundation of integrated systems, user groups, and existing applications.

Additionally, each customer on their platform generates network effects. Palantir can leverage the knowledge acquired and capabilities developed for a customer within a specific industry and incorporate it into the platform for the benefit of all customers across industries. For example, capabilities of Palantir’s platform that were originally developed to help optimize production of crude oil, has been adapted by manufacturers of medical equipment to optimize supply chains.

In addition to supporting individual institutions, Palantir’s platforms have the capacity to become the central operating system for entire industries and sectors.

Regulation

Section 2377 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (“FASA”) requires the U.S. government to first consider readily available commercial items before pursuing acquisition of custom developed items. Palantir’s software is a commercial item within the meaning of the law. A custom government solution built by a consulting company, is not.

In 2016, Palantir won a lawsuit against the Army, challenging its decision to pursue a software development contract for the replacement of its battlefield intelligence system. In 2018, the ruling was upheld, and the US Court of Appeals ordered the Army to consider existing commercially available products. After testing real products, the Army selected Palantir’s software to deploy tactical units across the force.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Privacy and civil liberties

Palantir is not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. They build software platforms that enable customers to integrate their own data – data they already have. Palantir claims to be committed to ensuring their software is effective as possible while preserving individuals’ fundamental rights to privacy and civil liberties.

Customer concentration

For the 9 months ended September 2020, Palantir’s top 3 customers accounted for 27% of their revenue.

Palantir’s revenue has had a CAGR of 68.8% since inception, and 27.6% for the last three years.

For the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:

* Revenue of the government sector increased by $177M (73%), of the increase 84% was from existing customers.
* Revenue of the commercial sector increased by $80M (30%).
* COGS, Sales and Marketing, R&D, and SG&A expense increases consist primarily of an increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to recognition of cumulative stock-based compensation expense upon the Direct Listing related to the company’s restricted stock units. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in traveling expense related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Palantir uses a Contribution Margin as a key business metric to evaluate their financial performance, which has improved consistently over the last 4 quarters. In short, by achieving a higher contribution margin, the increase in revenue required for Palantir to break-even is smaller.

**Valuation Results**

[https://postimg.cc/kBF3v0cv](https://postimg.cc/kBF3v0cv)

The result of my [Valuation Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zMy8dkNFib7h-FkFtPZMf9bhH8DjE3XKf5t-HB_c5eY/edit?usp=sharing) indicate a **Value of Equity per share of $28.38**

Mayor assumptions of the valuation model include:

* By 2031, Palantir will gain 6% Market Share of a $119B market that grows 7.4% annually. This implies Palantir’s revenue will grow at a CAGR of 30% for 10 years.
* Palantir will achieve US GAAP operating margins of 23% by 2031.
* Terminal year growth rate of 5% and WACC of 7.5% after reaching a Beta of 1.0.
* Risk free rate of 2.5% and Equity Risk Premium of 5.5%

Follow the link to view the valuation model, it include references to all assumptions. Please feel free to download it, play with it, and share your conclusions.

**Investment Decision**

I believe that at its current price PLTR is a buy opportunity for the following reasons:

* The model’s revenue and margin growth assumptions are achievable and likely to be exceeded if PLTR successfully executes their growth strategies.
* The industry is driven by strong fundamentals, organizations that do not embrace digital transformation and big data will cease to exist.
* Even though Palantir’s moat is currently narrow, it could expand significantly if they are successful in establishing their software as a central operating system for various industries.",2021-01-22 12:39:06

- When you don’t buy it keeps going up
- When you buy is when it drops
- After you sell at a loss it goes back up

For some reason the market goes against your decisions. It’s taunting and laughing at you. It’s chosen you specifically and while Yahoo convos question “I don’t get it—why is this stock down today?” you know why.


Always buy, hold, stop looking at it every second, and stop making Reddit threads when you’re down 2%.",2020-08-10 05:36:23
1157,Sharing my top companies with you.,3015,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fyjaff/sharing_my_top_companies_with_you/,563,"I just finished my watchlist after evaluating 300+ companies. It took me two weeks of full-time reading financials, calculate the maths and look up news around the companies for the last year. You don't have to take anything for granted, I'm not a professional analyst, just a guy with a lot of time and a decent look on financials. I'm not here for credit, I just think it might help some people and since it took a lot of time, it feels like a waste if I didn't share it.

It's a lot of tech, but I feel like it's also the way to go, especially during this crisis. I'm mostly staying away from the financial and real estate, but will invest more when there's a more clear image on the situation later this year. Healthcare, Industrial, Military and Energy are very dependent on political changes, so I'm also careful with those. Anyway, here we go.

**- ALPHABET -A-.** Cash king, enough to pay off all their liabilities easily. Very nice growth over the years, even when they're so big. Most of the times, you see blue chips / market leaders stagnate, but not Google. Advertising will take a hit and there might be restrictions on online privacy in the upcoming years, but they are still very strong armed to take on those setbacks.

**- ARISTA NETWORKS.** Same as Google, very strong financials, growth and cash position. Only negative, is that they had a growth setback in Q4 of last year, but nothing indicates it's gonna keep on decaying. They will keep on gaining market cap from Cisco. Very innovative management team with experience in networking. They create high performance cloud networks for big datacenters. Microsoft and Facebook are some of their biggest clients.

**- FACEBOOK.** This is double, I feel like next two years is a make or break for Facebook. On one hand, they still need to improve a lot on AI and control on fake news. They had (and probably still have) privacy issues as well and they will lose a lot of advertising revenue this year. On the other hand, Facebook is expanding a lot to different parts of tech. They have Oculus coming out for VR and they just started with FB Gaming. It's also not only Facebook, but they own WhatsApp and Instagram as well. To me, those are great companies at the moment and have an insane amount of users. Their growth over the past 5 years was close to 300% and they are also cash heavy.

**- GALAPAGOS.** To give you some numbers: in comparison to 2017, they increased revenue by 469%, while expenses only increased by 111%. In comparison to 2015, numbers are 1391% and 253%. Their cash position is double the total liabilities and 10 times their expenses in 2019. You might say they're very ready to take on this crisis. On the operational side, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases and they're backed by biotech giant Gilead Sciences.

**- INCYTE GENOMICS.** Another biotech company with great financials. They even reduced expenses since 2017, while they generated 40% more revenue. This year, 25% more hedgefunds have bought into Incyte, making it a total of 46 hedgefunds who own shares in this company. There is also 17,10% of the company owned by insiders, which shows they strongly believe in their company as well. The average insider percentage of all companies in my watchlist will be 6-8%

**- LULULEMON ATHLETICA.** Steady growth. Cult-like following with their fitness programs. It's a real millennial staple. Very strategic store openings as well. I see a lot of growth potential, especially when they can get some celebrity athletes to wear their clothing. That will make their young and hip image even bigger. Quality wise, they are way better than giants like Nike and Under Armour, which will also result in better image and growing customer fanbase.

**- MASTERCARD.** Very big profit margins (57% last year). One of the least best on financials in this list, but indispensable with a heavy growing e-commerce. Some might rather look at Visa, but I feel like Mastercard is more innovative. They invested in AI-powered authentication and cybersecurity. They are also more used by fintech companies, which is a sector that also will only grow the next 5-10 years.

**- MICROSOFT.** No brainer. Biggest company in the world. Since their new CEO, they're headed definitely in the right direction. Microsoft changed focus from hardware to cloud computing. The cloud services are still in their early year, I see an enormous growth potential. Also very big usage of Teams. It's a personal opinion, but with those quarantine restrictions, I feel like a lot of companies will realize letting their employees work from home has a lot of financial advantages, which will result in sale of more virtual working devices.

**- NVIDIA.** Market leader on semiconductors, making chips that process AI mathematic operations. They didn't grow that much in the last 3 years, but they are very cash heavy and ready to invest in the future. They are invested in all the big things for the future. Cloud, data, AI, gaming,... Some say GPU's are the best investment for the next 5, 10, 25 years, since you will find them in literally everything. For example, it will become an essential part of self-driving cars.

**- VEEVA SYSTEMS.** One of the youngest company in this list, specialized in cloud computing in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. Best of both world if you ask me. It's revenue is mostly based on subscriptions, so there are almost no surprised there. That's also the main reason why this stock is so expensive. They have beaten revenue expectations for 20 quarters in a row now. Innovative CEO, who will keep on searching to diversify and growing, getting more into data and programmatic advertising. Financial wise, they also have enough cash to pay off all their liabilities and to get through at least one year without any income.

One last thing: These companies are picked based on financials and future outlook, I didn't take value into account. I know companies like Lululemon Athletica and Veeva Systems are expensive, quite overvalued. I'm not buying into them right now, but maybe in the future.

Hope it helped at least one of you out there, enjoy the Easter weekend!

WSB used to be a funny little subreddit in which you could discuss serious DD and also post your losses on stupid trades (no upvotes for green accounts), now it's some kind of weird echo chamber and it's suddenly ""cool"" to be part of it and also take part in every stupid idea people there come up with, not to mention it's toxic, e.g. harrassing Andrew Left is not okay, you might not agree with him, but he has made some valid points most people don't even want to consider because of mob mentality, just the keep the insults out of this sub please.

It feels like the same kind of people are now slowly taking over this sub, sorting posts by ""new"" is pointless because the same stupid questions that could be answered with a 10 second Google search are asked every 10 minutes, if you don't have the patience for that, or even reading the sidebar you shouldn't be able to post here and spam this sub because it drowns the few actually interesting questions and discussions that don't concern Gamestop, Palantir or Blackberry or gambling away your family's life savings. The worst thing is that people who have no clue get positively reinforced by members of this sub ""yeah totally yolo all your savings into GME"". This is not WSB, people should at least put some thought into their posts.

The moderators should be a lot tougher again and curate the sub more, keep out the toxicity, make sure people get useful advice and are not lead into financial ruin (some can't tell the difference between irony and serious advice). Several uses have suggested to put more of an emphasis on to FAQ and Q&A sections as well, many people already use the daily threads and and post good questions and discussions, let's increase its use.

The quality has deteriorated so much, I almost don't feel like scrolling through the sub anymore.

Excuse the wall of text but it's been bothering me for a while now, anybody else feel the same way or am I just delusional?

1160,I predict Amazon will acquire Lyft in the next 18 months.,2962,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9su0zw/i_predict_amazon_will_acquire_lyft_in_the_next_18/,388,"Lyft is five times cheaper to acquire than Uber. It has 35% of ridesharing marketshare in America and is rapidly growing in Canada—two of Amazon's biggest market. 

Currently, no major Western ridesharing platform is profitable. That's because it takes a ton of costly promotions and subsidies on both the rider and driver sides to grow a ridesharing platform. 

Amazon, however, could substantially reduce the high cost of new rider acquisition by just offering their over 100 million Prime members a discount for using Lyft over Uber. This would shift marketshare overnight. 

Then, on the driver side, Lyft drivers could be doing last mile order fulfillment for Prime Now and Amazon Restaurant when ride demand is low—effectively increasing driver wages through removing time spent waiting for a new passenger while also lowering Amazon's fulfillment costs. 

The operational efficiencies that come from owning both commerce and ridesharing would allow Amazon to become the most valuable company in the world.

Uber and Amazon are already competing on a ton of fronts. AmazonFresh and UberEats, Uber freight and amazon prime delivery. My money is on Bezos to win though, they can shoulder the massive costs with AWS",2018-10-31 11:57:12

The home improvement retailer said Tuesday it will invest $1 billion in what it calls ‘incremental compensation’ annually for its workers. A Home Depot spokesperson declined to share specifics on how much the company’s average hourly wage will increase after the investment.

“It varies market by market. Our compensation, at all levels, is based on skills, responsibilities, performance and market rates,” the spokesperson told Yahoo Finance. [According to Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/The-Home-Depot-Hourly-Pay-E655.htm), the average hourly wage for a Home Depot cashier is $11 an hour. A sales associate earns $12 an hour, per Glassdoor.

The spokesperson said the “majority” of Home Depot’s 400,000 total employees will receive a pay bump from the new investment.

Other big box chains — sitting on big profits as consumers have stocked up on food and cleaning products amidst the pandemic — have also opened their wallets.

In July, [Target raised its starting wage for its store](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-raises-minimum-wage-for-store-distribution-and-headquarter-employees-114504219.html), distribution and headquarter employees to $15 an hour. The move impacted 275,000 employees who work at the company’s stores and distribution centers. Target raised its starting minimum wage to $13 an hour in June as part of a commitment unveiled in 2017 to reach $15 an hour by 2020.

Walmart in September lifted its minimum wage to $15 an hour from $11 an hour for some 165,000 workers.

The world’s largest retailer’s pay hike comes as the company calls for lawmakers to enact a new stimulus plan for those unemployed because of the pandemic.

“I think the lack of stimulus is showing up more so with those unemployed, small businesses and people that need help. I think it’s important that we all understand in some ways we are having a shared experience because we are in a pandemic together, but we are having a very different experience. If you have been let go and don’t have income, you really need help. The voice we have at Walmart is to say to Congress and the administration we need you to help those people who need help,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said recently at the [Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit](https://finance.yahoo.com/live/allmarketssummit/).

Discovered the internet. Asked my teacher “who owns the internet?” He said “no one, but AOL and Microsoft seem to be the most involved. My parents had put away some bonds for me, so I used that money to buy 100 shares of both companies (I believe they were $10 or under). 

Made about $60,000. Sold stock and bought a house a block from the beach in Southern California for $500,000 in 2000. Sold that two years later for $600,000. Everyone celebrate.

Got married, continued to buy houses and make money. Got divorced in 2006, lost about 50% of equity in the crash. 

That first beach house is now worth $2+ million. And I don’t even want to do the math on profit if I had kept the stocks.

1168,Bezos sells more than $3 billion worth of Amazon shares,2820,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jo7xm6/bezos_sells_more_than_3_billion_worth_of_amazon/,455,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos this week has sold more than $3 billion worth of shares in his company, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission compiled by OpenInsider.

Bezos has accelerated his stock sales in the last year. In August, Bezos offloaded more than $3.1 billion of Amazon shares, after selling more than $4.1 billion worth of shares in February. The sales this week bring his total cash out in 2020 to more than $10.2 billion so far, which is a notable jump from 2019, when Bezos sold $2.8 billion worth of shares.

Even with the latest stock sale, Bezos still owns more than 53 million shares worth nearly $170 billion, making him the richest person in the world.

The transactions were made as part of a prearranged 10b5-1 trading plan, according to the filings. Amazon declined to comment on the latest sale.

Bezos has previously said he sells about $1 billion of Amazon stock each year to fund his rocket start-up, Blue Origin. Additionally, the Amazon CEO in February launched a $10 billion Earth Fund to combat the effects of climate change, which will issue grants to scientists, activists and other organizations.

While Bezos hasn't yet announced the recipients of the fund, The Atlantic reported Tuesday that Bezos is expected to give $100 million each to the Nature Conservancy, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the World Wildlife Fund.

A slew of financial statements and emails obtained by American Oversight show that Amazon accounted for nearly $3.9 billion in revenue and $1.6 billion in profit for the postal service in the fiscal year of 2019, the Washington Post reported. 

USPS delivered 1.54 billion packages for Amazon during the time period, or roughly 30% of the technology company's total volume, according to the documents, which also show that deliveries and revenue increased in fiscal year 2019.

Simply put, in return for the lower rates, the USPS keeps a large customer, and staves off a possible future in which Amazon builds out its own delivery fleet, including drone deliveries for rual areas, to the extent it doesn't need the USPS's delivery network — or even begins competing with USPS to deliver some non-Amazon packages as well.

According to analysis by S3 Partners, short investors in Tesla— those who placed bets in the market that its shares would lose value — have lost $35 billion on those positions so far this year.

Tesla short sellers lost $8.5 billion in November alone, as the company's shares climbed 46% in the month. That's more than the $6.7 billion Tesla itself lost in the 11 years from when it first reported results in 2008 to the end of last year. 

Dusaniwsky said many of the shorts have closed out their positions — the number of Tesla shares held by short sellers is down 63% so far this year. But he said many are still unwilling to change their minds, despite the losses.

More than 1,000 workers at the Tyson Foods plant in Waterloo have tested positive for the coronavirus, a county public health leader said Thursday - more than double the number Gov. Kim Reynolds had said the day before.

The 1,031 Tyson employees confirmed to have the coronavirus included workers who were tested at the plant during the shutdown as well as at private health-care providers, Black Hawk County public officials said.

Reynolds said Wednesday that 444 workers at Tyson's Waterloo plant had tested positive.

The others were Tyson pork processing plants in Columbus Junction and Perry, and an Iowa Premium beef processing plant in Tama.Joshua Pikora, disease surveillance and investigation manager in Black Hawk County, where the Waterloo plant is located, said the governor's numbers for Waterloo reflected tests conducted only at the Tyson plant, not at health facilities elsewhere.

Steve Stouffer, president of Tyson Fresh Meats, and Tom Hart, the Waterloo plant manager, detailed the added measures the company has taken to ensure worker safety.

1181,This is why stocks are going up,2617,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/guqlgw/this_is_why_stocks_are_going_up/,513,"I get it, many people are scratching their heads over why the stock market keeps going up, including professionals. They point to the terrible economic numbers and worsening social situation. But they are missing the point.

The stock market is going up because the value of the US currency, relative to productive assets, is going down. When the Fed prints trillions, and the amount of assets stays the same or declines at a rate lower than the increase in currency, this inflate asset prices. It's not captured in inflation numbers because of the way CPI is calculated and because of how these new supply of currency is distributed. We saw this after the financial crisis -- not much inflation in consumer goods, but massive inflation in housing and the stock market.

The stock market will continue to go up as long as the Fed continues to increase the supply of currency faster than the decline in earnings.

Source: me. I manage money.

\*\*\*

Edit: Also look at gold, for example GLD. It's going up. All limited assets are going up because the USD is losing value. Since the USD is a key reserve currency with \~ 2/3 share, a lot of foreigners are subsidizing US asset owners. I learned this from Ray Dalio.

Also, I don't like gold. Why? Because its value as a currency & store of value has greatly been reduced by innovation in financial technology. What are you going to do, pay with gold? I don't think so. It is my view that equities of top tier companies, given it's liquidity and scarcity, is a better store of value and a better currency than gold.

Again, the world isn't crazy, most people just don't understand that currencies are being devalued relative to securities.

\*\*\*

Edit 2: So why are riots good for the market. One, it limits the US government's ability to escalate geopolitical issues, which means less screwing around with the supply chain, which is good for large cap stocks, which drives the indices that we call ""the market"". Two, unrest will incentivize the government to stimulate on the monetary and fiscal front.

\*\*\*

Edit 3: I read every comment and there are a lot of confusion out there. A big one is that many are still holding on to the traditional definition of inflation, as in the CPI, which is a basket of goods and services. Yes, CPI does not suggest we are having inflation in the narrow way inflation is defined by it. When the Fed, for example, buys treasuries, they create new money which is deposited in the bank account of the treasury seller. These treasury sellers tend to be large institutions and very wealthy people, so they are not spending that money on goods and services (i.e. CPI items) but instead using that money to buy investment assets (corporate bonds, stocks, gold, etc -- which are NOT CPI items). This is why price for goods and services are not rising as fast as the price of investment assets.

The second confusion is if the USD is losing value, why is it appreciating against other currencies. I am strictly talking about USD losing value relative to assets like corporate equity, so it is a totally different matter. The USD vs. other currencies is huge topic that I can't possibly cover here. Basically, the USD, as the dominant reserve currency backed by the biggest and most stable economy, is viewed as a safe haven so demand for USD increases when risk increases. So although the Fed is printing a lot of money, in the short term, demand for USD relative to other currencies still leads to the strengthening of the dollar. Also keep in mind that several other developed countries, for example Japan, have negative rates. So although the USD strengthens against other currencies, it weakens relative to investment assets -- hence asset price inflation.

KEY POINTS
Congress reached a deal Sunday on a $900 billion coronavirus relief package, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Lawmakers will move to vote on the proposal, along with a full-year government spending bill, as soon as Sunday night.
Millions of Americans have awaited aid for months as Congress failed to agree on another plan to boost a health-care system and economy buckling under the weight of the pandemic.

Congress reached a deal Sunday on a $900 billion coronavirus relief package, a long-delayed effort to boost an American health-care system and economy buckling under the weight of the pandemic.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced the agreement on a pandemic aid and full-year government spending bill. He did not delve into many details. Congressional leaders have not yet released text of the more than $2 trillion legislation, which they hope to pass in the coming hours.

The agreement follows months of sniping on Capitol Hill over how best to fight a once-in-a-century crisis. A new round of aid cannot come soon enough for the millions of Americans who have tried to scrape together enough money to afford food and housing.

The $900 billion coronavirus relief plan under negotiation on Capitol Hill was set to include direct payments of $600 to many adults. Some families were also expected to get $600 per child.

The proposal was set to put at least $300 billion into small business assistance including Paycheck Protection Program loans. It would also add a $300 federal unemployment supplement and temporarily keep in place pandemic-era programs that expanded unemployment insurance eligibility.

If those provisions expire the day after Christmas, 12 million people will lose unemployment benefits.

The measure was also set to put critical funding into the distribution of the two FDA-approved Covid-19 vaccines. Health-care workers and top government officials have started to receive shots, and widespread inoculation in the coming months will help the world to emerge from the pandemic’s shadow.

The rescue package was also set to send relief to hospitals, many of which have struggled to keep up with a flood of Covid-19 patients. It was also expected to put new money into education and transportation.

As lawmakers finally reach a deal, the help comes too late for the nearly 8 million people estimated to have fallen into poverty since June. Many in Congress say the proposal will not go nearly far enough to address the scope of the health and economic crisis.

Progressives and some Republicans have pushed for larger direct payments and retroactive federal unemployment payments. A $600 weekly supplement that buoyed millions of jobless Americans in the early months of the pandemic expired over the summer, and it took Congress months to agree to reinstate it.",2020-12-21 10:00:55

1195,A philosophy for the new (young) investor,2447,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gx8hhk/a_philosophy_for_the_new_young_investor/,243,"""Why did I not buy x in March, I could have a 250% return right now""
""Damn, I should've poured my entire fucking life savings into $BITCH when I saw that DD post on it a week ago""
""I should've just held, sold way too early and now it's up $3""
Been seeing a lot of posts along the lines of these statements for the past few weeks.  The volatility of the market bestowing random lotto wins upon a handful of risk takers, who then proceed to (justifiably) claim bragging rights along with their newfound cash isn't helping the issue.  People will, of course, daydream themselves into a similar scenario, and the likelihood of a large, UNeducated gamble increases with each ""missed"" opportunity perceived.  

For those of you who are in your university years or a little past, we're looking at most likely a baseline hourly wage of $12.50 (CA assumption).  This is what you'd be standing on your feet for 8 hours a day to earn, a daily intake of roughly $80 after taxes, all the while dealing with the dumb shit that presents itself in every entry level position.  

Did your trade today result in a profit greater than $80?  Congratulations, you have no cause to be regretful.  Did your profit for the week average out to greater than $400?  Nice, you just made a week's salary without enduring the arduous process of punching in a time card every day.  Maybe you made double, triple that, quadruple, or even 10 times that in the span of a week or less.  You should be ecstatic; you just earned several months' paychecks in a fraction of the time and with a sliver of the work.  Maybe you have an actual job on top of this windfall; now you've doubled your financial stability (or more) and that out of state trip with your friends is no longer unrealistic. Of course within the lens of Reddit's investing discourse, taking away 1 to 4 grand when your play could have, if left alone, increased to 15 or 20 grand, might make you feel a bit empty for a while.  But outside of this context and in the world of wage workers, securing that much in such a short time span is so ridiculously fortunate; several of my university acquaintances slave terrible hours for minimum wage to make tuition or rent payments, and it would take them months to assemble what you and I may consider, in all our eagerness, a ""small"" profit. A trade that, in our view, was pulled too early would be enough to make them speechless.

Maybe the stock or contract climbs after you sell.  So long as you beat your working average, consider it a win.  Don't think ""what if"".  Just count your cash.

Edit 2: Thanks for the kind words. Never expected a response of this magnitude when typing my thoughts out.

For those who are thinking of selling today, I want you to go back to that date when you bought the stock, whatever stock it was. Ask yourself: ”Why did I buy this stock?” 

Then ask yourself: ”Has the situation changed?” Do you still see the same qualities that made you invest in the company? 

If you see the same qualities that you saw at the start, continue what you are doing. There’s no reason to sell the stock, right? If anything, buy more!

Stick to your original strategy. I’d just keep doing that DCA and buy the dips. Today is a great day to do that. Don’t worry.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**QQQ** \- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks. (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft). Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE. (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).

**VOO**/**SPY** \- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VGT**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**. There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.

**IWF** \- This is a Russell 1000 Growth fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different. Other funds that use the Russell 1000 Growth Index include **RWGV** and **VONG**. I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.  **VONE** and **IWB** use the Russell 1000 Index as their benchmark.  **SPYG** and **VOOG** use the S&P 500 Growth Index for their benchmark and would be similar (but not identical) to **IWF**, **VONG** and **RWGV**.

**IWM** \- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies. Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market. It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.

**VXUS** \- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas. I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future. XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.

**EEM** \- iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF - This one is going to have a lot of crossover with **VXUS**. It is an Emerging Markets ETF with a lot of focus on China. It includes Alibaba, Tencent, [JD.com](https://jd.com/), along with companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors. This one should be a solid performer as long as our trade relations with China remain normal.

**EFA** \- This is another international ETF, but here the focus is mainly on more established companies in Europe and Japan. This is a Large Cap ETF that includes companies like Nestle SA, Roche, Toyota, Novartis and AstraZeneca.

**S*****ector fund ETFs:***

**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies. QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them ""electric vehicle"" funds, as well. No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.

**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.

* **ARKG** \- Genomic Revolution
* **ARKF** \- Fintech
* **ARKK** \- Disruptive Companies (broader market)
* **ARKW** \- Internet/computer/technology (Telsa is a top holding)
* **ARKQ** \- Robotics and artificial intelligence
* **PRNT** \- 3D printing technology
* **IZRL** \- disruptive companies based in Israel

**XL series of funds**. Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:

* **XLV** \- Health Care
* **XLK** \- Technology
* **XLY** \- Consumer Discretionary
* **XLF** \- Financial
* **XLU** \- Utilities
* **XLE** \- Energy
* **XLB** \- Materials
* **XLC** \- Communications
* **XLG** \- S&P Top 50
* **XLI** \- Industrial
* **XLP** \- Consumer Staples
* **XLRE** \- Real Estate

**CLOUD COMPUTING:** **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance. Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**. Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.

Despite a coronavirus shutdown this year that temporarily halted most TV production, Netflix plans to release even more originals in 2021 than in 2020 — which would mark the latest achievement for a company’s whose massive investment in original content inspires both envy and ridicule.

Last year, Netflix spent $15 billion on content, which put its investment even with ViacomCBS (VIAC) but behind Comcast (CMCSA) at $15.4 billion and Disney (DIS), which shelled out $27.8 billion — according to data compiled by Variety. The streaming giant will up its spend this year to $17.3 billion, most of which will go toward original content, said BMO Capital Markets analyst Dan Salmon in January.

Netflix added nearly 26 million subscribers over the first six months of this year, bringing its total subscribers worldwide to about 193 million. By comparison, Disney Plus had 60.5 million subscribers worldwide as of Aug. 3 — though the platform has operated for a far shorter time, having launched last November.

1219,"Stock-market wizard William O'Neil famously turned $5,000 into $200,000 in just a few years. Here's the 7-part model he uses to sniff out winning stocks.",2242,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ieax69/stockmarket_wizard_william_oneil_famously_turned/,261,"""I went through the same process that most people do. I subscribed to a few investment letters and most of them didn't do too well.""

That's what William O'Neil, the legendary trader and author of ""How to Make Money in Stocks,"" told Jack Schwager in a 1989 interview for his classic ""Market Wizards"" series.

Out of frustration, O'Neil took the matter into his own hands. He knew a better way to trade was out there — all he had to do was uncover it. After all, he was seeing an array of fund managers crush the competition.

""Back in 1959, I did a study of the people that were doing very well in the market,"" he said. ""At that time, the Dreyfus fund was a very small fund, managing only about $15 million. Jack Dreyfus, who managed the fund, was doubling the results of all his competitors.""

O'Neil scoured Dreyfus' quarterly reports, searching tirelessly for any commonalities he could apply to his own methodology. After mapping out more than 100 of Dreyfus' stock purchase points, O'Neil hit pay dirt.

""There were over 100 of these securities and when I laid them out on a table, I made my first real discovery: Not some, not most, but every single stock had been bought when it went to a new high price,"" he said.

That unearthing opened the flood gates. O'Neil knew there were more secrets waiting to be uncovered. 

The search continued. 

O'Neil shifted his focus to the market's biggest winners, trying to connect the dots between the characteristics of certain stocks and their superior performance. Eventually, his research culminated in a simple seven-part model: CANSLIM.

Allow O'Neil to explain:

""Each letter of this name represents one of the seven chief characteristics of the all-time great winning stocks during their early developing stages, just before they made huge advances,"" he said.

O'Neil's discovery translated to massive profits.

""During 1962-63, by pyramiding the profits in three exceptional back-to-back trades — short Korvette, long Chrysler, and long Syntex — he managed to parlay an initial $5,000 investment into $200,000,"" Schwager said.

Let's take a closer look at O'Neil's famed CANSLIM principles. All quotes below are from O'Neil.

C: 'Current earnings per share'

""The 'C' stands for current earnings per share,"" he said. ""So, our first basic rule in stock selection is that quarterly earnings per share should be up by at least 20 to 50 percent year to year.""

A: 'Annual earnings per share'

""In our studies, the prior five-year average annual compounded earnings growth rate of outstanding performing stocks at their early emerging stage was 24%,"" he said. ""Ideally, each year's earnings per share should show an increase over the prior year's earnings.""

N - 'Something New'

""The 'new' can be a new product or service, a change in the industry, or new management,"" he said. ""In our research we found that 95 percent of the greatest winners had something new that fell within these categories.""

S - 'Shares outstanding'

""Ninety-five percent of the stocks that performed best in our studies had less than twenty-five million shares of capitalization during the period when they had their best performance,"" he said. ""Many institutional investors handicap themselves by restricting their purchases to only large-capitalization companies.""

L - 'Leader or laggard'

""So, another basic rule in stock selection is to pick the leading stocks — the ones with the high relative strength values — and avoid the laggard stocks,"" he said. ""I tend to restrict purchases to companies with relative strength ranks above 80.""

I - 'Institutional sponsorship'

""Leading stocks usually have institutional backing,"" he said. ""However, although some institutional sponsorship is desired, excessive sponsorship is not, because it would be a source of large selling if anything went wrong with the company or the market in general.""

M - 'Market'

""Three out of four stocks will go in the same direction as a significant move in the market averages,"" he said. ""That is why you need to learn how to interpret price and volume on a daily basis for signs that the market has topped.""",2020-08-22 13:56:16

1224,Infinite Short Squeeze Explained | Blue Appron Case Study | GME Infinite Short Squueze,2184,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l21gpz/infinite_short_squeeze_explained_blue_appron_case/,1027,"This post will describe the behaviour of an infinite short squeeze using Blue Appron as a case study.  On March 16, 2020.  Blue Appron stock priced moved from 2.30 to 28.00 in ONE DAY.   ***That's an 1100% gain in one day with the stock price.  Options moved over 100000% that day.*** The reason was an infinite short squeeze similar to the one that is happening with GME.

&#x200B;

# Blue Appron Short Interest (SI)

During that period Blue Apron's short interest was 50%.  Blue Apron was running out of cash and shorts piled on.  Then the pandemic happened an people started ordering meal kits en mass, infusing Blue Apron with large inflows of cash.  Fearing, meal kits had become a secular trend like ride sharing, shorts started to cover.  But they soon discovered shares were limited.  So the infinite squeeze happened.  *They had to cover at any price to balance their books when Market makers started to sell off their other positions.*

&#x200B;

# GME Short Interest

Currently GME Short Interest is rumored to be above 100% \[1\].  Thus the environment is similar to the Blue Appron infinite short squeeze.  Namely, there are no shares for GME shorts to cover, once the infinite squeeze occurs and MM forces them to balance their books.

Moreover, the squeeze hasn't happened yet, given that the Short Interest hasn't moved lower.  In fact, it has been rumored short interest has increased as shorts make a last ditch effort to scare off the bulls.  But the markets is aware how the conditions are there for an infinite short squeeze.

&#x200B;

# Behaviour of an Infinite Short Squeeze

The behaviour of an infinite short squeeze (ISS) are violent.  In financial history, the two widely cited cases are the VW infinite squeeze of '08 and the Blue Appron one of '20.  As you can see, infinite short squeezes have been rare because most rational agents would never get themselves into a situation which would lead to an ISS.

When shares can't be covered and stock price increases, shorts are forced to cover by Market Makers.  But because of the huge supply/demand imbalance, shorts have to cover at prices that would seem irrational on a cursory glance but are rational based on the supply/demand equilibrium of available shares.  ***Consequently, it is normal to see 1000% increases in one day.  And 100000% gains in 0dte options.***

As more market player realize the infinite short squeeze is inevitable, the tripping point of the squeeze collapses from months to days to hours.   *The only way shorts can alleviate the narrative of inevitably is to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD).  So as long as GME stock positions are maintained, and more shares are bought, the short squeeze is inevitable.*

Owning stock or options are better than a lottery ticket because the odds are in your favor.

1225,Oil stocks - the time is now,2168,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/iexyez/oil_stocks_the_time_is_now/,495,"Hello there

I posted about [6 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hn9ydm/defense_stocks_what_the_heck_is_going_on/) about defense being undervalued and they’ve climbed 15-20% since then (besides HII which completely whiffed earnings). Hope you hopped on. Now I am now starting to see value in the oil sector(s). The June high and subsequent re-crash for oil industry coincided directly with the new covid case rate picking up. With covid cases declining and oil stocks generally trading in ranges for over a month now, I present my case for a break in those ranges

There are a couple of tailwinds that are happening right now for WTI:

* New covid cases in the US have dropped substantially from their peak and are on a downtrend [according to JHU’s data](https://i.imgur.com/EShb2sU.jpg). Globally, it seems to be seesawing in a confined range
* [China is buying a large amount of US crude by September](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-oil-exclusive/exclusive-china-ramps-up-u-s-oil-purchases-ahead-of-trade-deal-review-sources-idUSKCN25A2F4), potentially 37 million barrels [according to this](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/China-Charters-Tankers-For-37-Million-Barrels-Of-US-Oil.html)
* After flooding the US market with [Saudi oil](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/04/850026351/saudi-arabias-oil-tanker-flotilla-is-reaching-the-u-s-despite-some-objections#:~:text=Live%20Sessions-,Saudi%20Arabia's%20Oil%20Tanker%20Flotilla%20Is%20Reaching%20The%20U.S.%2C%20Despite,are%20headed%20to%20the%20U.S.), they have now cut exports to a [record low ](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Saudi-Arabias-Crude-Oil-Exports-Dip-To-Record-Low-In-June.html)
* The dual storms in the Gulf have caused a lot of [shut-ins](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-storms-energy/oil-firms-evacuate-staff-curb-offshore-production-ahead-of-twin-storms-idUSKBN25I0J3)
* After stalling in July, air traffic is starting to [pick back up](https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput) and routes are being added again, although still way way down

Which all support WTI prices in the coming weeks. Should be noted that rig counts have continued to lows, however last week was the first week in a long time that a few rigs came back online, which will add to the inventory. How much, I am not sure. You can see from [Baker Hughes’ rig count]( https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/rig-count-overview) that we added 10 rigs, but are still down a net of 662 rigs from last year. Next we can take a look at the [EIA data](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/) for some more insight into what current inventories are like:

* 512M barrels of crude, 15% above average. Peak was 540M barrels on June 19th
* 244M barrels of gasoline, 7% above average. Peak was before covid due to build over the winter
* 178M barrels of distillates, 24% above average. Peak was 180M barrels on July 31st
* Refinery inputs at 14.5M barrels, low was 12.4M barrels on May 13th 
* Refinery rates at 81%. At the low on April 22nd it was at 67%, normally around 95%.
* WTI is trading in the $42-43 range, with the low being negative due to the contract rollover situation back in the Spring

The last several EIA reports have been good in general – drawing down of products, with two weeks in a row of fantastic gasoline draw down. 

What’s my point here? The takeaway should be this: the worst is over and it seems we're about halfway recovered. Now is the best chance for a while to get beaten up value stocks at a discount, as the industry recovers and conditions for the crash are resolving

Right now cyclicals have been beaten down to Earth’s core as tech goes up and up. Cyclicals and value generally outperform in a market recovery and I expect a rotation at some point, strengthened by a combination of inventory drops making headlines, covid cases going down, and a general resumption of normal. Any stimulus would be big news for these beaten down stocks as well

Worried about a Democratic administration? Unlike the defense stocks I had previously looked at, I think it’s a real issue for this industry. The Democratic platform calls out removing tax breaks for oil and gas companies while adding environmental regulations. It’s weird that big tech has been climbing – companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook etc. that are known tax avoiders and privacy usurpers seem like prime candidates to have a ‘tax bill fear’ from the Dem’s closing of tax avoidance legislation and future lawsuits. I haven’t seen any hints of this in the market, so I am going to assume this is not considered a big deal by investors. Environmental regulations should be, however

However, I still believe these low valuations are still too low, even with headwinds. Some of the majors have already been adjusting (Shell in particular) and refineries like Valero already have strong renewable fuels segments; Phillips 66 recently announced plans to build the [biggest renewable diesel refinery in the world](https://investor.phillips66.com/financial-information/news-releases/news-release-details/2020/Phillips-66-Plans-to-Transform-San-Francisco-Refinery-into-Worlds-Largest-Renewable-Fuels-Plant/default.aspx)

What am I looking at in particular?

Right now, refineries have the best value to me. PSX is **criminally** undervalued with a safe dividend. VLO is another that is set for strong performance. MPC has a strong position after its Speedway asset sale, but I would rank PSX>VLO>MPC at this point for value.

* PSX target price: ~$82, sitting currently at ~$61
* VLO target price: ~$71-72, sitting currently at ~$52.50

From a producer standpoint, CVX and COP are both fundamentally solid (I prefer COP at this point). RDS is the closest its been to it’s covid low and is one of the leading majors in transitioning off oil. It’s been beaten down since losing its dividend but I can only assume it will be back. I’m not a fan of XOM going forward, but right now it’s at the low of the range it’s been confined in and wouldn’t be a bad temporary pickup. FANG / EOG / PXD aren’t bad pickups either

PS – stay away from OXY. It’s very clear they’re going to continue to issue shares until they’re through their debt and the pummeling is well deserved. It was popular for a while, not sure how it’s still viewed, just stay away

TLDR; buy refineries and the producers worth buying that aren't drowning in debt or have terrible assets

Disclosure: I have a large position in PSX calls",2020-08-23 16:43:32
1226,To all young investors,2169,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/h7u3dl/to_all_young_investors/,397,"I'm seeing a lot of posts from young investors (as young as 18), taking first steps into the stock market. Of course their capital's very small, often less than $1,000, and they are all excited to make big bucks fast.

I'm just genuinely worried that a lot of these investors are taking the stock market as a place to gamble, and not put any thoughts into the stocks they purchase, and take actions very emotionally. Too many of you are eyeing on penny stocks, or companies that have been beaten down so much from COVID, even filed for Chapter 11. 

Sure you may get very lucky and double your bank account in a week, and think to yourself, ""man I'm a good trader."" I believe there are people out there who are truly good traders. However, chances are that you are not one of them, and 99 percent of yall will lose money if not all in a few months. This is gambling and not any different from taking your $1,000 to Vegas and putting it into a slot machine. 

What I really want to tell you guys is, try to be patient, and buy stocks with a very constructive reasoning behind it. You spend hours thinking about how to spend $20 on clothes or shoes you want to buy. Then, why can't you put just as much thought, if not more, into stocks you will be investing hundreds of dollars in? If you are spending so much money on something, you gotta be able to convince not only yourself, but also your parents, friends, people, with a load of information, take constructive criticism, etc.! 

And really, keep buying, and get a habit of buying often. 1st of every month could be your investing day, and you will transfer like $50 dollars to your account to buy another, i don't know, Coca Cola stock. These small things will add up with the compound law, and in 10 years you won't believe where you are at. (If your initial investment grow 10% every year for 10 years, you will be up 150% in total, and S&P 500 does grow approximately 10% every year on average). 

So summing up, young investors, you started early and time is on your side. Always be patient and be thoughtful with your decisions! 

Good luck to yall!",2020-06-13 09:00:21
1227,"How I applied Buffet's strategies to my own portfolio, +70% networth, beat SP500 by 40%",2165,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ihyea8/how_i_applied_buffets_strategies_to_my_own/,549,"I believe I did pretty well in the market this year. My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -> Aug. 

I beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180->300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)

I did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. 

I did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. 

#High level advice:
=========================================

I picked the 7 I agree with.

1. Invest in what you know…and nothing more.
2. Never compromise on business quality
3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever
4. Diversification can be dangerous
5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)
8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)
10. Only listen to those you know and trust 

I firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  

#General mindset:
================
- Keep emotions out of the market
- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.
- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. 
- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. 
- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)
- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. 

#Application:
==================================================================
I was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. 

As a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. 

Based on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good ""feel"" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). 

I tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. 

Post COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.

My hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. 

1. eCommerce + AdTech 
2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)
3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)

These are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:

1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?
2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?
3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? 
4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?
5. Who are their customers and target demographic?
6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.

In March, I took what I believe to be an ""educated gamble"". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.

*EDIT* ^^^ this isn't called timing the market you /r/wsb imbeciles. Timing the market would be trying to figure out when to PULL OUT during ATH and then buying the dip. I SOLD at the lowest point, and I with the cash I sold AT A LOSS, I reinvested that cash and doubled down into tech. If I sold in Feb, and bought back in March, that would be calling timing the market. What I am doing is called REINVESTING/REBALANCING... not timing the market. 

I have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.

Here are the non FAANGs I chose.

1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. 

2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.

3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. 

4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.

5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. 

6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.

7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. ""Zoom parties"" and ""Zoom dates"" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.

8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. 

10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.

11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. 

12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. 

13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say ""Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?"" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.

14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.

Mutual funds/ETFs
1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. 

2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. 

3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly...

I was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.

#Some things I do that that are against the grain:

- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.

- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.

- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. 

One example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. 

Lastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. 

Also, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision.",2020-08-28 12:58:08

> Lots of posts in this sub asking for advice on how to make money based on riots, and the fact is no one gives a shit and there’s no money to be made on that.

The whole post is filled with top-level comments joking about how everyone on Reddit is stupid for asking and how there's so clearly no money to be made just because people are rioting. To all those looking for opportunity, this is why you should take everything you read on Reddit with a dump truck full of salt.

Clearly the OP of that thread hasn't even been trading long enough, or wasn't active enough in the markets to remember the [almost completely identical situation in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014-2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_unrest) which sent the stocks of three companies flying, among others that made similar but smaller moves. 

[DGLY \(Digital Ally, Inc\)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=dgly) makes police body cameras and went HAM in August of 2014 as the riots in Ferguson heated up, [rising from under $4.00 to almost $34.00 (yes that's 750%) in less than a month](https://i.imgur.com/QWWBEtq.png)

[ISNS \(Image Sensing Systems Inc\)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=isns) makes video and radar processing equipment primarily used in traffic management and traffic data collection. While not a direct riot play, in 2014 it caught momentum from day traders trading DGLY and [rose from $2.50 to $10.00 in six days.](https://i.imgur.com/8vHHf1Z.png). Oh yeah, and it's headquartered in St. Paul, MN, right in the guts of Minneapolis.

[TASR \(TASER International, now trading under the ticker AAXN\)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aaxn) makes tasers, body cameras and video recording systems for police and has a market cap of nearly $5 billion. It was the leader of the rallies in the ""riot stocks"" in 2014 which triggered all the low float ones like ISNS and DGLY to take off. Between July of 2014 and July of 2015 [it rose from $10.50 to $36.00](https://i.imgur.com/zzZpAuI.png), largely driven by speculation about the effect the riots would have on police regulations.

By the way, DGLY is up 33% today with no news or SEC filings to be found. Coincidence? I don't think so. Traders who were involved in it in 2014 remember its potential just like everyone remembered IBIO and LAKE at the beginning of the coronavirus situation. Where did they remember them from? The Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, where both of them did almost the exact same thing they did this time around.

Obviously, these companies aren't investments, and it doesn't matter if it's justified whether they take off like they did in 2014, but if the OP of the top post on this sub right now spent more time looking for opportunity or looking to history to guide them and less time posting uneducated and opinionated garbage on Reddit, maybe they would actually be able to make some money.

I started investing in 2017. I was proud of myself after going from $5000 to $6000 then I started taking huge risks on penny stocks, adding more money to my account, and soon found myself down huge. I walked away when I was down $5000. I came back a year ago with a new outlook. I recognized I had been making the same mistakes over and over and there were the big lessons I had to learn:

- be skeptical of a company you’ve never heard of; stay away completely until doing lots of research.
- hold good-performing stocks for a long time
- gains are gains; it doesn’t have to be sexy. As the adage goes, some of the most boring investments are the best investments.
- read the news (world news, national news, etc.)
- make a plan and stick to it unless you learn information that gives you evidence that your plan is worth changing.
- take advantage of the worst stock market crash ever (LOL)

I’m not an expert, I just wanted to share my story and offer hope to people who are newer investors who are losing lots of money...take a break, refocus, and come back when the time is right for you.

At present, investors are paying 22 times forward earnings to purchase stocks on the S&P 500, 50% higher than the 10-year average valuations across the index.

The forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divides the current share price of a company by its estimated future earnings per share (EPS).

Much of the market rally which took the U.S. benchmark from correction territory in March to an all-time high in August was driven by tech megastocks and a bullish options market.

""The buying that went on in August and September is a 10-year phenomenon the likes of which we have never seen, among millennials and in the risk-taking among people that don't want to own bonds and want to own overpriced U.S. quality businesses, it is of record proportions,"" Smead told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday.

He added that current valuations were an example of ""stock market failure"" driven by millennials speculating in the stock market for the first time. Smead projected that markets could be in for a nosedive since despite its monetary policy shoring up credit markets, the Federal Reserve ""can't save a stock market.""

""They are buying bullish call options that expire inside two weeks. There was ($500 billion) of bullish call options bought in a four-week stretch by small retail traders,"" Smead said.

A call option is a contract between the buyer and seller of the call to exchange a security, in this case a stock, at an agreed price.

""In '99 it was $100 billion, in '07, it was $100 billion. That is what young, dumb investors are doing and when the market makers see those (call buying) out there, they sell that call to that person and they buy the stock,"" Smead added.

He suggested that the willingness of wealthy investors and the baby boomer generation to ""ride the index to a fault"" and overpay for stalwart American businesses such as Costco and Microsoft was also detrimental.

""Microsoft is a wonderful company, but at 40 times earnings, there is a 0% chance of that producing wealth for someone over the next 10 years that will meet their needs.""

Despite a sharp tech sell-off in early September, Microsoft shares remain 40% higher since the turn of the year, while fellow tech titans Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix have all been on a tear since March's crash.

Now could be the best time for Amazon (AMZN) to dramatically increase the size of its air fleet. That’s according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post, who sees the depressed price of aircraft, coupled with the massive increase in demand for delivery services spurred by the coronavirus pandemic, as a golden opportunity for the ecommerce giant to pump cash into its Amazon Air division.

And while that would help Amazon increase its one-day shipping capabilities, it could also give it the firepower it needs to solidify its nascent third-party delivery business as a true competitor to the likes of FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS).",2020-05-28 09:21:33

When I was a kid, my step dad helped me invest $850 I had saved up in my first stock.   The first tech boom was just a few years away.

By the time I was a teen I had a full portfolio and was rocking it.  I had around $50k invested.  All from money I made working at a flower shop, computer repair shop, (and selling a bit of pot too if I am being honest), and buying stocks.  I was going to be the next Warren Buffett of course ... lol.

In 1999-2001 day trading took the internet by storm.  Even your cab driver had trading tips back then.  I got sucked in with many others, and I also got wiped out.  By early adult hood, I had blown out my account to 0 on dumb options plays, not knowing what I was doing and taking idiotic risk that I didn't fully understand.

For a decade I avoided the market mostly, even though it had once been such a passion.  I got a degree.  Went into a different industry.

Sadly at some point along the way again, I thought I could be a 'trader'.  I went through similar cycles as the first time (perhaps with a bit more knowledge, wisdom and maturity than the first time).  The game is even harder now though.  The HFT's and Algo's are programmed just so perfectly to squeeze out your money, even if it is one penny at a time.  Once again, after wasting many years, I found myself at the bottom.

I will spare you the rest and jump straight to the ending:  I am nearing 36 years old, and my portfolio is nearly non existent.  I am not poor, and I own a nice little business ... but I am also filled with regret.

Had I never started trading, and had I just continued investing, I would probably be a multi millionaire based on the trajectory I was headed by this point.  I also would have gotten to skip many years of shame, doubt and guilt.

The amount of people in this day and age that are actually successful traders are so god damn few and far in between.  There is a reason the entire world has moved to quant systems.  Computers trade better than humans filled with emotions.

Moral of the story for you youngins' out there:  Buy and hold.  Maybe don't buy today at the peak of a fed induced 10+ year bull run and wait for a market correction in the next few years (ironic that I would be giving financial advice by the way), but when the opportunity strikes .... buy and hold.  Make smart investments.   Don't take dumb un-necessary risks.  Sometimes the boring stocks are the absolute best ones.

The stock market shouldn't be exciting.  It shouldn't be something that makes you lose sleep or feel anxiety.  It shouldn't be 'fun'.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa/florida-arizona-nevada-hit-daily-highs-for-covid-19-cases-idUSKBN23Y0MR

""Nevada disclosed 1,099 new cases, double its previous high.""

At the height of the pandemic for New York, in the second half of March, they were averaging about 9k cases a day. New York has a population of 19.4M people, meaning roughly 1 new case every day for every 2,160 people in New York in March. Nevada, with 3M people, set a record for themselves of 1 new case for every 2,700 people. And the numbers in Nevada are increasing fast. Nevada could pass New York's worst day in per capita terms in a week.

I just can't see the casinos there remaining open, and even if they do stay open, no one will want to visit from out of state.

**EDIT:** Turns out the overly big jump on June 26 was due to data from lab reports dated 23 and 24 June being included in the 26 June total. However, the brand-new numbers reported for today, June 27th are likely a new record even though weekends are usually lower numbers.

https://www.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/news-release/public-health-update-covid-19-case-increase/

""After a review of the case data, it was determined the increase in reports was due to a delay in laboratory reporting. More than 240 of the cases reported were from laboratory reports dated June 23, and more than 380 were from reports dated June 24.""

I currently hold Tesla, Google and Amazon.

When I got into stock market, I found it fun and exciting to be part of the company that you’re investing, especially when you see their scability and development. I started to live frugally, reduce expense as much as I can, and invest the rest into the companies that I know and truly believe—from brand to business system. However, I still enjoy the good stuff like reading book, exercise, meditation, chilling at the local beach but I avoid intensive leisures like travel or expensive concerts because it cost me a lot money.

To anyone who had a similar situation that I currently have in their 20s, how did this work for you? What regrets did you had? Is it worth to sacrifice the intensive fun stuff in your 20s?

1246,My Investing Roadmap,1953,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k0t986/my_investing_roadmap/,290,"So you want to begin buying stocks?  I’m 33 years old, and begin investing during college (more than 10 years ago).  I’ve learned a ton, and built a substantial portfolio over the 13ish years since I began.  I’ve also done a lot of dumb stuff over the years, and learned a lot of expensive lessons. To me, this is the roadmap to begin investing.  



***Step 1) Be sure you’re financially ready to begin investing.***
In my view, building an investment portfolio is like framing a house.  This is an incredibly important step in your financial security, but needs to be done after you’ve laid the foundation.  I highly recommend Dave Ramsey’s baby steps (I consider my stock account baby step 4).  Read this and watch his youtube.  Bonus points if you can answer callers questions before Dave does on his radio show.  Another great resource is /r/financialindependence .  your stock portfolio should not be money you need in the next 5 years, preferably 20 years.  Put it in there, and don’t take it out.


***Step 2) understand your goals the first year (Year 0-1)***
In the first year of investing you have three main goals.

 
•	**Don’t chicken out.**  Pulling the trigger is the hardest part.  You make your first buy then you open your account 30 times the same day to see how it’s performing.  You’re probably doing this not because you’re afraid of losing money, but you’re afraid of failure or looking stupid.  You might tell yourself, if I learn to do research I can increase my chances of being right. This is dumb.  The most important thing is to start the trip.  Think to yourself, if you need to travel across the country by road and your options are to take the minivan you have now, or wait 3 days until you can get a sports car. Which is a smarter move?  Get your ass in the minivan.

•	**Don’t commit a financial blunder.**  For any of you who play any competitive video game with a ladder you know there is a commonality across all of them.  To climb out of the bottom 50% of any ladder, all you have to do is not commit blunders.  You don’t have to do anything fancy, you don’t have to be flashy, just don’t fuck up.  This is 100% true in the stock market as well.  This means you don’t have to do any financial analysis your first year.  Keep everything as simple as you can to start.  There is still plenty to learn from investing in an ETF the first year, and the third bullet will take enormous amounts of energy.

•	**Learn to manage your emotions.**  The first year is an emotional whirlwind no matter how much you’re investing.  Your primary goal above everything else is to learn to act calmly.  If you check your account value every day, you’re training your brain to inject dopamine every time your account goes up.  This is really, really bad.  You’re going to have a bad day in the market, and your brain doesn’t get the dopamine hit that It’s used to. This leads to panic selling and grief.  If you learn this skill early, I’m 100% convinced your set for life.  The rest is easy.
The other part of this bullet is Reddit is the Instagram of stock market gains.  People only post what they want you to see.  Only the best get upvoted.  This gives us a warped sense of reality, and what our expectations should be in investing.  Don’t get caught in the hype. Don’t YOLO.

***Step 3) what do I do after that? (Year 2-5)***
Holy shit, if you make it here, the fun begins. If you can master your emotions you can then begin to nurture this hobby.  Continue regular contributions to your account. Once it’s in the stock account, don’t think of it as spending money anymore, it’s now investment money.  Find elements of the stock market that interest you and learn more about it.  

If I were to give one thing that you should begin learning now and have down cold it would be “What changes a stock’s price and how does that relate to the value of a company?”

-understand what market capitalization is, an how it relates to a stock price.  What financial tricks can a company play, and how will that affect the stock price, but not the market cap? To me, this is critical to understand.

-be able to know the rough market cap if any major public company you come in contact with on a regular basis. 

-Time value of money.  You don’t need to know the math, just the concept.  How this relates to opportunity cost. 

-understand how earnings and earnings calls actually affect stock price.  You don’t need to actually monitor these, but just understand how earnings and earnings expectations relate.

Once you get that down you’ll find other areas of stocks/ finance that interest you. Do you like to do financial analysis? Learn that.  Do you like to think big picture? Invest your time there.

***Become an investor, not a trader.  Investors are “good business collectors”.***

As you contribute more money into your account, begin picking up individual companies.  Your contributions should be retentively small compared to your overall portfolio.  If it’s not, then contribute more to your ETF.  For the next 5 years, commit to having no more than ½ of your portfolio in individual companies.  This will mitigate risk, and allow you to learn about individual companies and how to look at them.  My suggested method for finding your first few individual companies are “What industries are coming in the 3-5 years, and what companies are the best positioned to be there”.  Only do that for industries you understand (unless you’re a doctor don’t mess with bio-tech).  Some of the meme stocks, are actually great for small individual stock pickups in this stage.  Don’t invest in penny stocks (or anything with a market cap under $2B) until you know what you’re doing.  I’ve lost way more money in shit like this than anything.  Also, don’t fall for value traps (moderate or shitty companies selling for a deep discount).  It might work every once in awhile, but that’s not our game.

At the end of the day, keep this as simple as possible.  If something doesn't feel right, dont do it.  I hope this gives you the push you need to get started, and help someone out there.",2020-11-26 01:36:09

1249,"Elon Musk says Tesla deliveries will rise 30% to 40% in 2020, touts new battery tech",1936,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ixyrff/elon_musk_says_tesla_deliveries_will_rise_30_to/,484,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday he expects vehicle deliveries to increase by 30 to 40 percent over last year, when the company reported deliveries of 367,500 vehicles. The new guidance from Musk implies deliveries of between 477,750 and 514,500 cars, a range that encompasses the company’s previously stated goal to deliver half a million cars in 2020.

Musk offered the updated numbers during the company’s 2020 shareholder’s meeting on Tuesday afternoon, which was accompanied by a presentation about Tesla’s battery advances. After thanking Tesla owners for their word-of-mouth marketing, he noted: 


“In 2019, we had 50% growth. And I think we’ll do really pretty well in 2020, probably somewhere between 30 to 40 percent growth, despite a lot of very difficult circumstances.”

The company’s shares dropped more than 6% during the presentation, which took place after normal trading hours.

During the “battery day” portion of the presentation, Tesla confirmed that it is making its own battery cells at a facility in Fremont.

Joining Musk on stage, Tesla’s senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering, Drew Baglino, described the new cells as a “large tabless cell,” with a “shingled spiral” design. The cells are larger than the ones Tesla purchases from Panasonic and other suppliers, and offer “thermal benefits” which make them appropriate for use in electric vehicles. 

Baglino said battery, manufacturing and design changes underway at Tesla would eventually “unlock” a 54% improvement in the range of the company’s vehicles.

Musk, who is famous for being overly optimistic on such matters, said with all the battery and manufacturing advances Tesla is working on: “About 3 years from now, we’re confident we can make a very compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that’s also fully autonomous.” 

Near-term, Tesla says it aims to produce 10 gigawatt hours worth of its new battery cells at its pilot plant within a year. Musk noted that whatever cells it produces in Fremont would be supplemental to 100 gigawatt hours worth of cells it buys from suppliers. The company also said it had secured rights to a lithium clay deposit in Nevada to mine for its batteries.

On Monday, Musk warned that the advances announced at battery day won’t find their way into mass production until 2021, sending the company’s stock down about 6% ahead of the event on Tuesday.

Due partly to Covid-19 health orders that limit the size of in-person gatherings, Tesla postponed its annual meeting from July this year to Sept. 22, 2020. The company previously held its shareholder meetings at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California but moved the event to Fremont, where its U.S. vehicle assembly plant is based. Shareholders parked and sat in their cars at the meeting, which Musk characterized as a “drive-in.” They honked in lieu of applause.

Those who wanted to attend had to obtain a winning lottery-style ticket (or other special access) to the meeting. Otherwise, shareholders could log into a website to ask questions to be answered during the live-streamed event.

Since its last shareholder meeting in June 2019, Tesla’s long-time CTO JB Straubel resigned from the company. He worked there from the start, even before Musk took the CEO reins in 2008.

Tesla also appointed a new board member, Hiromichi Mizuno, formerly the Chief Investment Officer of the Japan Government Pension Investment Fund, and a famous critic of shortsellers. Long-time Elon Musk collaborator and proponent, venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson, is leaving the Tesla board as well, though he still sits on the board of Musk’s aerospace venture, SpaceX.

Remaining board members at Tesla authorized a five-for-one stock split, which the company implemented in August this year. The split followed four consecutive quarters of reported profitability for Tesla, and a season where Musk clashed with health authorities in California over Covid-19 restrictions that temporarily shut down their vehicle assembly plant in Fremont.

The stock split also followed a huge payout to Musk, part of his unprecedented compensation package. 

Expecting Tesla to talk about where its metals for batteries are sourced, and to promote battery tech suitable for Semi and Cybertruck vehicles, Cannacord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a note to investors before the meeting:

“The big question will be on follow through. It’s one thing to announce all these breakthroughs, which might be great for momentum algorithms, but like most things TSLA, the devil will be in the details, which sadly will take some time to play out.”

Cannacord maintains a “Hold” rating and a price target of $442 on shares of Tesla currently.

Shares of the electric car maker are up more than 400% year-to-date.

1250,A guide for those looking to invest in Renewable Energy. (My Renewable portfolio with DD),1932,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ice312/a_guide_for_those_looking_to_invest_in_renewable/,322,"I've dedicated a large percentage of my portfolio to renewable energy companies and have obtained some knowledge on the sector and specific companies in doing so. I've noticed a trend of people inquiring about these companies so I hope that this post can provide some information. 

---------------------------

I'll provide a brief bullish thesis and some information about my investments in renewables. These are in order of weight in my portfolio. 

------------------------------

Tesla (TSLA)     (511% gain) 

Most of us know what Tesla is about. They are the global leader in electric vehicles and will eventually come out with autonomous driving but I'll focus on their energy business. They sell solar panels with the lowest cost/watt of U.S. manufacturers, but this isn't the exciting part of their energy business. They are a leader in battery storage, which is an integral part of a renewable future. Energy storage systems store energy produced from solar panels and when the sun isn't shining, energy is consumed from the batteries instead. Also their autobidder software, which is out in trial in Massachusetts and Australia I believe, eventually will turn energy into a market place for Tesla customers. Read more about autobidder here: https://www.tesla.com/support/autobidder 

My bull case for Tesla (specifically the energy side of the business) is that they will continue to innovate with their low cost panels, and be a leader in battery storage, plus leverage their autobidder software to bring added value to residential customers.

--------------------------------------

Vestas Wind Systems (VWDRY)         (91.4% gain)

https://www.vestas.com/~/media/vestas/investor/investor%20pdf/financial%20reports/2020/q2/2020%20q2_pres.pdf

Vestas is the leading manufacturer and installer of wind turbines. They have a global footprint and are expected to grow in line with the growth of the wind industry as a whole. A major growth engine in their business is going to be their expanding service and maintenance business, which has very high margins. My bull case for Vestas is that they are a unique pure play wind turbine company with years of experience in the growing industry. 

--------------------------------

First Solar (FSLR).    (24% gain)

First Solar is an American based solar module manufacturing and solar project operating company. Most of their business comes from corporate and grid level solar projects. Notably, they have Next Era Energy, Microsoft and Apple as customers. The real bullish case behind First Solar is around their differentiated Cadmium Telluride solar modules. Compared to the standard Crystalline silicon technology, First Solar's modules last longer and produce energy at higher efficiencies in hotter climates. 

My bull case for First Solar is around their differentiated technology, strong balance sheet, and position as an American company, which typically warrants a higher P/E ratio than foreign companies. 

----------------------------------

Jinko Solar (JKS)         (22% gain)

https://ir.jinkosolar.com/static-files/5a6d9266-d288-4ece-a0ea-f8e49ff60119

Jinko Solar is a leader is a Chinese based solar panel manufacturer. They produce low cost modules and also manage solar projects. Their business model is similar to First Solar's, however they trade at a cheaper valuation, due to being a Chinese company. You can read more about their technology on their investor relations page, but my main bull case for this company is around their position in South East Asia as a leading manufacturer, as this is undoubtably the biggest potential market for solar energy. 

--------------------------

Canadian Solar (CSIQ)           (27.5% gain)

http://investors.canadiansolar.com/events

Canadian Solar is also a leader in the module manufacturing & project development business. They have a similar business model with Jinko and First Solar. Canadian Solar owns equity stakes in several of their solar projects, which gives them a source of recurring revenue. They also have a large footprint in American grid/commercial systems and are a market leader in North America. 
They trade at an absurdly low 5 P/E ratio despite significant growth expectations in the coming years. 

My bull case for CSIQ is around their ability to dominate the current market and potential to capitalize off of further market growth and consolidation towards the biggest solar companies. Also their current valuation is very intriguing. 

--------------------------

SolarEdge (SEDG)           (126% gain)

https://investors.solaredge.com/

SolarEdge is the global leader in the Inverter space, with a 60% U.S. market share. For those who don't know, Inverter's turn the D.C. electrical current from the sun into an A.C. current, which is used by households. The inverter business is also much higher margin than the module (panel) business, due to there being fewer players in the industry. They are also expanding into energy storage and electric vehicle manufacturing. 

My bull case around SolarEdge is around their market dominance in the Solar Inverter business, which will grow exponentially in the coming years plus future expansion in storage & EVs. They have a very strong management team as well. 

--------------------------

TPI composites (TPIC).            (70.55% gain)
  
https://ir.tpicomposites.com/download/companies/tpicomposites/Supplements/TPI%20Earnings%20Deck%202Q20.pdf

TPI composites manufacturers wind blades and sells them to wind turbine companies. They have long term contracts with the top 5 non Chinese wind turbine companies (Vestas, GE, Siemens, Nordex & Enercon.) 63% of total wind blade manufacturing is outsourced to companies like TPI and they are the market leader in this space with about 20% market share globally. The business currently has low margins, but they target a 12% EBITDA margin for the future, and they trade at a measly 0.74 P/S ratio currently. They are also expanding into EV composite manufacturing and have a contract with a certain EV company that I can't mention on this subreddit apparently (DM if you want more info) to manufacture vehicle parts for them.

-------------------

Enphase Energy (ENPH)        (46% gain)

https://investor.enphase.com/static-files/81902e59-7d61-4693-aa86-8d54e63975b9

Enphase is the sole producer of Microinverters, which are smaller inverters that go on individual panels and provide a safer, more efficient, but more expensive solution than the standard string inverters. Microinverters are used in smaller solar systems, mostly residential. They also have an energy storage business that is just starting to scale. Enphase and SolarEdge are competitors in both of these spaces, and are expected to be major players in the future. Like SolarEdge, Enphases' inverter business is high margin and expects rapid future growth, as the residential solar market grows. 

My bullish case around Enphase is around their Microinverter technology, potential for expansion into storage and unique Ensamble home energy management system (read about Ensamble on the Investor relations page). 

-----------------------

Brookfield Renewables (BEPC).          (12% gain)

https://bep.brookfield.com/~/media/Files/B/Brookfield-BEP-IR-V2/events-and-presentations/bep-investor-brochure-q1-2020-vf.pdf

Brookfield Renewables owns and operates renewable energy systems and projects. They sell energy produced from such systems to utility companies and have a recurring revenue stream. They also pay a 3.73% dividend yield. Their investments are split between Hydroelectric, solar and wind. 

My bullish thesis around BEPC is the consistent cash flow positive revenue stream and relative safety in the business model. Also, they provide me with exposure to hydroelectric energy.

1255,Options Trading Basics for Beginners💥,1860,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g3odl6/options_trading_basics_for_beginners/,238,"I want to preface this post by saying that I *personally* only trade stocks at the moment and do not have a ton of experience trading options, which is why all of my posts and education are based around stocks. With that being said, I have done my fair share of options trading in the past and definitely know enough of the basics to share for all the traders that ask me about options on a daily basis. If you already have a bit of experience with options, this post may not be very beneficial to you because I'm just going to cover the basics of options, how they work, and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them!

First and foremost, **what are options?** Options are actually... *options*. When you buy an option contract, you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a pre-determined price up to a pre-specified date. If you decide to do this, you are then ""exercising"" your options.

There are two types of options that you can trade, which are call options and put options. **Call options,** or just ""calls,"" allow the holder to **buy** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock. Because of this, your call options' price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises. **Put options,** or just ""puts,"" allow the holder to **sell** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to short-selling the underlying stock. Because of this, your put options' price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines. Because one single option contract represent 100 shares of the underlying stock, you would have 100 shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised.

[https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y](https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y) 

Now, the pre-determined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contract(s) is known as the **strike price.** When buying options you have to choose a strike price, along with an **expiration date,** which is the last day that your options can be exercised. Both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy, because they greatly affect how the options will trade. Before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options, it's important to know a bit more general options information.

*As for strike prices,* there are really two main kinds. **In The Money (ITM)** and **Out of The Money (OTM)**. ITM and OTM refer to the underlying stock's price in relation to the strike price of the contract. Calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered ITM, whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered OTM. On the other side of the spectrum... since you want the stock's price to go down when you own puts, your put options would be ITM if the strike price is above the current stock price and OTM if the strike price is below the current stock price.

[https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP](https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP) 

I know it's a bit confusing if you're new to options. **To give an example:** If stock XYZ was trading at $100, a call option with a strike price of $90 would be ITM since the underlying stock is already above the strike price. However since calls and puts are essentially opposite, a put with a strike price of $90 would be an OTM put in this scenario.

Whether an option is ITM or OTM has a big impact on how to option will trade. The main reason for this is because **all** OTM options are **worthless** at expiration. This means that if you invested $100 by buying one call option at $1.00 ($1.00 x 100), your contract would be worth $0 if it was OTM at the market's close on the expiration date and you would lose your full $100 investment. Because of this, OTM options are generally higher risk, higher reward than ITM options. Although ITM won't be worthless at expiration like OTM options, they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay.

**Time decay** in options causes the price of the contracts, also known as the **premium**, to decrease as it gets closer to expiration. This alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion, because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time, both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay. So in order to profit from options, you have to not only be right about the stock's direction, but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay.

Time decay, along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts, are represented by what are known as **Greeks.** The Greeks are theta, vega, delta, and gamma. Like I said, the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so I'm not going to go into a ton of detail on the Greeks in this post, but I do at least want to explain theta. **Theta** is the greek representing time decay in options. You can see an options theta (along with the other Greeks) before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay. Generally, the theta will be higher for OTM options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at $0. Similarly, theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration, because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches.

Theta makes general trading rules like *""don't fight the trend""* even more important. For example, if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom, you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support. So in this situation you'd be correct about the stock finding the bottom, but you would still lose money if it didn't start to bounce back up quickly. If you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options, you'd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support.

Although time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades, there is actually a way to have it work in your favor. You can short options contracts, which is also called **writing.** Just like with shorting stocks, you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short. In my opinion, this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling.

The reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts, you would lose money as the options increase in price. It's the same reason that many people are afraid to short-sell stocks, but options are generally more volatile, which creates even more risk. Even though I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for beginners, I wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post.

Regardless of how you trade options, it's important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced. Like any other type of trading, you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options... especially if you're trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their expiration, which are the ones that attract so many traders because of their ability to make big runs in a short period of time.

Maybe after this you'll see why I stick to trading stocks rather than options. They can definitely be a great tools for experienced traders, but they're much more complex than most new traders think and can be very dangerous for inexperienced traders that are enticed by the big potential returns.

1256,"1,5 Years Since My Journey Began, $52 591 dollars wealthier & only 18 months left.",1835,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hiwzgo/15_years_since_my_journey_began_52_591_dollars/,288,"*Introduction*

I'm 20 years old and my interest for the stock market began at age 16 which later grew into becoming my lovely addiction and before graduating high school i already had a detailed plan on how i would become financial independent and self employed as quick as possible, the first milestone to reach before continuing my dreams are to reach an entire net worth of $100 000 dollars.

In the beginning of setting the $100 000 dollar goal i started with $13 953 dollars and today 1,5 years later i have a total net worth of $66 544 dollars which basically means i only have 33,45% left of the goal to complete within 18 months which is entirely possible. It felt so much harder in the beginning but hard work pays off. While creating the plan i expected to have $52 730 dollars this month of the year but from making better decisions, working hard and presumably a little touch of luck i'm 5 months ahead.

I maximized the overtime-limit at my workplace last year which is roughly 200 hours per year, i managed to reach 212h, sadly the overtime is cancelled due to covid-19 but currently i have 24h 36m in overtime. I've driven taxi *(illegally which i stopped doing)*, been cutting lawns an lending out money in order to speed up the process of my journey.

I've cut almost all unnecessary expenses, i don't travel, i rarely drink alcohol, still driving around in my $1 000 dollar car watching others laugh at me but don't get me wrong, i enjoy traveling and eventfully i'm going to buy myself a new car, i don't want to create wealth just to stare at it. This is something i been planning for a very long time and that i'm fully committed to. It's psychologically frustrating but in the end it's definitely going to be worth it.

*Portfolio distribution*

* *Stocks: 35,79% ($23 816)*
* *Funds: 8,27% ($5 503)*
* *Ready assets:* 55,93% ($37 218)
* *Stocks:* ATVI, AAPL, **AZN**, BAC, **CAST**, DAL, MSFT, **HUFV A**, **KIND SDB**, NFLX, NVDA, **SWED A**, UBER
* *Funds:* **Avanza Auto 6, Avanza USA, Spiltan Aktiefond Investmentbolag**

note: *The Tickers with bold fonts are swedish stocks/funds which may not be available in your country.*

I sold a majority of my shares in the beginning of 2020 expecting a recession or correction but instead we got covid-19 which was extremely unpredictable so i was really lucky that i already had a pretty high amount in liquidity. So far i've been taking advantage of the pandemic by investing in stocks that i hopefully believe will recover. I also did some Q1 report trading which made me about $3 000 dollars profit, i traded CAST, GOOG, TWTR and I'm constantly looking for opportunities.

I'm expected to be fully invested within 1 year and i'm not stressed by having 55,93% liquidity since the inflation is 0. The *""fear of missing out""* is also nothing that's bothering me, everything can happen, especially now.

*Income, expenses & conditions*

My monthly income varies depending on how much i work but i averaged $3 008 dollars after taxes during 2019, i invest everything except $500 dollars and the reason how i can invest 83,37% of my monthly income is because i still live at home. The only reason why i still live at home is so i can take advantage of the opportunity to invest and build myself a foundation.

*The Missing piece*

What i'm missing is friends and connections with this interest in common, i rarely have anyone to talk with when it comes to investments and such so i really hope that i can reach out to some of you. If you're interested just send me a message, thanks for reading and if you have any questions i'll be happy to answer.",2020-07-01 08:42:56

1263,Pros and cons of investing in 5 upcoming tech IPOs from Airbnb to Roblox,1796,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3okkw/pros_and_cons_of_investing_in_5_upcoming_tech/,394,"December and January aren't typically busy months for initial public stock offerings, but this time around, they'll be an exception. Almost a half dozen well-known tech startups, each already valued privately at over $1 billion, have recently filed for IPOs, including Airbnb, DoorDash, and Roblox.

They're hoping to take advantage of strong investor appetite for tech stocks, despite the pandemic, and to catch the coat tails of other tech companies that have recently made [successful debuts](https://fortune.com/2020/08/29/2020-ipos-palantir-tech-ipo-asana-snowflake-predictions/). Shares in cloud database company Snowflake are up 129% since its September IPO and those of data mining company Palantir are up 215% since its September listing.

Here are key details to consider in weighing whether to invest in the latest batch of would-be public tech companies. Financial data is from the first nine months of 2020 unless otherwise indicated.

## Affirm

Symbol: AFRM  
Fiscal 2020 revenue: $510 million (fiscal year ended June 30)  
Revenue growth: 93%  
Gross margin: n/a  
Net loss: $113 million

[Affirm’s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm)

Founded in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Affirm aims to [bring credit and lending to customers of all kinds of online retailers](https://fortune.com/2020/02/05/credit-cards-levchin-affirm-ceo-daily/). Those hard-to-miss layaway offers for a pair of shoes from Cole Haan or that cute coffee table on West Elm’s website? Affirm works behind the scenes to process the loans and often covers the cost of the item (in some cases, partner banks fund the loans). So far, Affirm has signed up over 6,500 retailer and helped consumers pay for almost $11 billion worth of products over the past three years.

**Pros**: Affirm says its “buy now, pay later” system is superior to credit cards, with no hidden fees or high interest rates (most Affirm offers are zero interest rate). Like other hot consumer companies, Affirm also touts its net promoter score of 78, suggesting more than three-quarters of customers would recommend the company.  As e-commerce grows, there’s plenty of room for growth in the market—less than 1% of e-commerce transactions in North America relied on “buy now pay later” deals. And Affirm says its data analysis of consumers’ ability to pay lets it avoid major losses.

**Cons**: The largest e-commerce sites, like [Amazon](https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/) and [Walmart](https://fortune.com/company/walmart/), have no need for Affirm and could even launch their own lending services. So could big banks or other financial institutions that can borrow money more cheaply than Affirm can. And more than one-quarter of all of Affirm’s lending has so far come from customers of a single retail partner: Peloton.

## Airbnb

Symbol: ABNB  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $2.52 billion  
Revenue growth: -32%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $697 million

[Airbnb’s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)

As the now-famous story goes, Airbnb co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia decided to rent some airbeds in their San Francisco apartment after a big design conference caused local hotels to be fully booked. Their little web site, AirBedandBreakfast.com, eventually grew into the titan that has rented space to 825 million customers cumulatively across 220 countries.

**Pros**: The fast-growing startup took a huge hit when COVID-19 curbed travel, but has since [almost bounced back](https://fortune.com/2020/06/30/airbnbceo-brian-chesky-bookings-rentals-recovery-2020-ipo-coronavirus-pandemic/). Bookings were down 72% in April compared to the same month in 2019, but for June through September, the declined narrowed to 19% to 23%. The company also brags in its regulatory filing that pandemic-related spending cuts, including slashing headcount by 25%, make it more efficient going forward.

**Cons**: The pandemic showed that the travel industry is subject to sharp downturns that cut into Airbnb’s sales, and infections are on the rise again worldwide. The company has also battled restrictive rules in many cities and countries seeking to ban short-term rentals. Airbnb's filing disclosed it’s also in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service that could cost it $1.4 billion if it loses. And even after being in business for more than a decade, Airbnb is still on pace to lose around $1 billion this year.

## DoorDash

Symbol: DASH  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.92 billion  
Revenue growth: 226%  
Gross margin: 53%  
Net loss: $149 million

[DoorDash S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm)

After moving to the U.S. as a child, DoorDash co-founder and CEO Tony Xu worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant to help make ends meet. The point of DoorDash, he says, is to help strivers and small businesses thrive. Now in business for seven years, DoorDash “dashers” deliver food and other items from almost 400,000 businesses to 18 million consumers per month as of September.

**Pros**: DoorDash is the leading provider of delivery with over twice the market share of runner up Uber Eats as of October 2020. The pandemic has [ignited much faster growth](https://fortune.com/2020/05/25/coronavirus-jobs-food-delivery-doordash/) in food delivery as people avoid going out to eat. Some smaller players have already sold out (DoorDash bought Square’s Caviar service for $410 million last year), but further consolidation could let DoorDash charge more for its services.

**Cons**: Once the pandemic passes, many DoorDash customers [may return to eating](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/can-doordash-maintain-its-pandemic-boost/) in restaurants. Although California voters approved a measure to continue to classify gig workers like DoorDash’s dashers as independent contractors, other governments still are trying to classify gig workers as employees, which could wreck DoorDash’s business model.

## Roblox

Symbol: RBLX  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $589 million  
Revenue growth: 68%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $206 million

[Roblox S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm)

Much more than a video game, Roblox has become a virtual environment for millions of people and companies [to create their own games](https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/roblox-100-million-monthly-active-users/). Co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel went from making software simulations for physics labs to creating Roblox in 2004. Now some 31 million people play daily, including three-quarters of all U.S. kids age 9 to 12, the company says (Research firm Dubit put the figure at [half of kids 9 to 12 this summer)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/technology/roblox-tweens-videogame-coronavirus.html).

**Pros**: Roblox has plenty of reasons for developers to stick around, including its large devoted customer base and the Lua scripting language that makes it easier to make new games. About two-thirds of current users are from the U.S. and Canada, so there is room for considerable overseas expansion.

**Cons**: The pandemic super-charged Roblox growth rate, but kids may decide to put their screens down and play more outside after the crisis ends. Many users play on devices running [Apple](https://fortune.com/company/apple/) or [Google](https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/) software, putting Roblox somewhat at the mercy of the twin tech titans’ app policies. Other games have been banned and the app stores decide how much of each sale they are entitled to. A joint venture with Tencent to bring Roblox to China could be impacted by increasing trade tensions or new restrictions. And gaming and social media platforms come and go depending on the latest fads. Roblox could be the MySpace of gaming.

## Wish (ContextLogic)

Symbol: WISH  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.75 billion  
Revenue growth: 32%  
Gross margin: 65%  
Net loss: $176 million

[Wish S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312520298630/d82777ds1.htm)

Overshadowed by better known rivals like Amazon, [Alibaba](https://fortune.com/company/alibaba-group-holding/), and [eBay](https://fortune.com/company/ebay/), Wish [focuses its e-commerce services](https://fortune.com/2020/11/20/online-marketplace-wish-files-for-ipo/) on the “affordable” segment of consumers. Founded in 2010, Wish now helps more then 500,000 online sellers hawk goods to 100 million monthly active shoppers. Parent company ContextLogic has its name on the IPO registration filing.

**Pros**: Shopping online isn’t just for the wealthy. Wish says it's targeting the 44% of U.S. consumers and 85% of Europeans who have household incomes of $75,000 or less, plus shoppers in developing countries. Wish’s platform is mobile first, and 90% of purchases happen via its mobile app. Although Wish doesn't make a profit, it generated free cash flow (or cash from operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment) of $23 million in the first nine months of 2020.

**Cons**: Wish faces off against many larger rivals, such as Amazon, Alibaba and eBay, plus Shopify and Walmart. To compete against the giants, Wish spends vast sums, over $1 billion so far in 2020, on marketing. With deep connections in China, U.S.-based Wish could be hurt by worsening trade tensions. And as with other startups dependent on mobile apps, Google and Apple could undermine Wish’s business with new rules or requirements.

1266,"You asked me to look into the renewable energy sector, so here it is.",1789,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g0o33t/you_asked_me_to_look_into_the_renewable_energy/,313,"After my last post, I had multiple people asking if I could take a deeper look into the renewable energy industry. Since I’m also very interested and I feel it will become a very important sector, I took the time to review it. First of all, let me explain why investing now is a good time. 

When you look at manufacturers, the biggest market cap is not even $5 billion. There is so much room for growth and there’s also a lot of competition. When you can point your finger at the best company, it might be the homerun for your portfolio in 10-15 years. Even if you don’t hit the right one, it’s still gonna be ok since the industry is only growing. To be clear, I only looked at manufacturers, not distributors. You won’t see any companies like NEE, DUK, BEP, etc. 

Secondly, you all know Trump doesn’t believe in environmentally issues, renewable energy and that sort of stuff. With elections coming up, investments might stay the same or they might go up drastically when the democrats win. Either way, the sector will continue to grow and you can’t really go bad with investing in it. 

Last argument, I feel like a lot of people don’t know the importance of solar energy yet. It goes beyond the industry, as it gets implemented more and more by other industries. It’s already a big item for giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon,… to keep their cloud servers running for example. 

— — — — — — — — — —

In this post, I will focus on solar energy the most, as it is the biggest and most important part of renewable energy. Based on market cap from the solar industry, we have 3 leaders and 7 others on a significant distance, but still able to get to the top for the next 5-10 years. From that top 10, RUN, SPWR and VSLR fall off based on financials.  

**ENPH**  
Market leader on micro-inverters (the things that convert solar charge into electricity). Even their inverters get used by big competitors like SPWR. Investing more and more into energy storage. It’s focussing on the private market, which might be a short term problem, but their inverters are definitely their big win. Not only do they receive revenue from their own installations, but they have other companies using their products as well when installing other products, making ENPH techniques present in an enormous amount of solar installations. The financials are great, they have a decent amount of cash to get investing and they’re only profitable since last year, giving them a lot of room to grow. They’re bound to get number one position in solar tech and they didn’t even launch their best technology yet. 

**SEDG**  
Great financials as well. Assets over double amount of liabilities, almost no long term debt and enough cash to get growing. Very big growth on revenue. They were planning to even double their production in 2020 and release some new products, but that’s gonna be delayed a bit. They are working with TSLA on batteries and charging stations. It all looks very positive, although I have to point out some people are calling SEDG ‘yesterday’s solution’. It might be up and keep growing a lot, but if you want the best 10 year investment, you should stick with ENPH. 

**FSLR**  
Very inconsistent income, but a great balance sheet. Assets 3 times liabilities and loads of cash to get investing into the future. Their profit margins are pretty small though, in comparison to the industry. FSLR is the only company that works with utility companies to provide energy. To draw you a simple picture: if you get electric energy at home, it’s been delivered by utility companies and the energy itself is mostly created by FSLR. Over the past few years, utilities are losing market share because people are buying and setting up their own energy installations at home. Therefore utilities, and by extension FSLR, are losing market share. Because of the crisis, people will be less likely to install their own installations as unemployment numbers are rising. FSLR could be the better short term bet, but it’s hard to predict when it will turn around again and they will definitely lose long term. 

**JKS**  
Very innovative techniques, one of the most efficient solar panels on the market. Therefore gaining a lot of advantage on their competitors, or ‘moat’ by Warren Buffett terms. If you feel like solar panels are the most important part of the industry, I would definitely suggest looking into JinkoSolar. They have a lot of cash to get investing, low on long term debt and I see them coming the closest to top 3 in the future.

**CSIQ**  
Looking for value, then this is the one. PEG ratio of only 0.19, the industrial average is 0.68. Have to point out as well that their growth rate isn’t that great and you might wait a long long time to get the gains going on this one. They also have a lawsuit running against them, claiming to steal Solaria’s patented module technology. 

**NOVA**  
They might get hit hard by covid-19. Sunnova is a pretty young company, full on investing and expanding, thus having low cash reserves. They might need to be backed by bailout money, putting them even further behind the top 5 solar companies. When they get back in 1-2 years, I feel like the other companies will have too much of a head start. 

**AZRE**  
They have experienced almost no impact from covid-19 as an Indian based company. Their projects have not been impacted and the plants are running full force. However there has been significant reduction in demand and they’ve been seeing delayed payments from customers. It operates like First Solar, selling energy to government utilities. Big profit margins as well, so they might get out of this crisis easily. That’s also the main reason why the stock didn’t drop that much. Growth will be limited, but a stable investment. 

— — — — — — — — — —

Next, I’m gonna mention some other renewable energy resources. I took one of the best companies per industry as an example, but I’m not gonna go through those resources more deeply as I don’t believe in them.

**VWDRY**  
The wind energy industry is more inconsistent than solar energy, therefore not the most favorable kind of resource to invest in. It also doesn’t have real potential to expand to private use, but whoever wants to invest in it, I suggest VWDRY. It is the biggest company in the world in terms of wind power. Apart from having the most and biggest wind farms, they also offer their maintenance and knowledge to help optimizing other wind farm locations. Vestas also just signed a great contract with a Danish energy company for delivery in the upcoming next years. They have a lot of cash ready to invest and they also have decent value, so you can’t really go wrong with them.

**REGI**  
REGI produces and sells biofuels and renewable chemicals. It produces biomass-based diesel, using corn oil, used cooking oil and inedible animal fat amongst other things. The company might be in bad weather, as they are low on cash. They are operating in an investment needing industry, so it’s definitely not the right moment for a financial crisis like this.

As you can see, I didn’t include nuclear energy companies. Nuclear energy is a green energy solution and definitely isn’t bad. However it’s not growing like solar and wind because it has a lot of negative feedback and image. There is more waste, it’s more expensive and therefore also less investments. It’s easy math, the more volume, the lower price. No one is investing in nuclear, so pricing can’t compete with other resources. 

— — — — — — — — — —

For me, this research was surprising. I was expecting to find more small companies with breaking innovative techniques, but it seems like the ones at the top are predicted to stay there and increase distance. If anyone has some valuable information on small companies, definitely share them in this thread.

To conclude, ENPH and SEDG are without a doubt the best investments right now. Depending on your timeline, you might want to sell SEDG in 5-10 years, while keeping ENPH for a lifetime. JKS is the higher risk, higher reward kinda bet here, with still decent coverage of risk.

There are of course way more other renewable energy resources, but I don’t know enough about them. If I would start researching them, I might be working like a professional broker/investor and I decided that I’ve put enough energy into stock research the past weeks. Right now, I’m gonna enjoy the weather, work a bit in the garden and passively buy some shares this week with all that info I’ve gathered over the past few months.",2020-04-14 04:59:53

Hey all!

Due to the coronavirus, a ton of executives are participating in unusual compensation/purchasing activity. So I have begun scraping the SEC website to see which executives are purchasing, selling, or being awarded stock for no known reason except that the stock price is extra low and they may just be buying their stock at a discount (or selling it before it crashes further).

Obviously, we don't know how long the coronavirus may keep the market down, but this can help us see which executives believe their stock will rebound nicely and which believe it will continue to decline.

1271,NVidia – Know What You Own,1766,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gln51p/nvidia_know_what_you_own/,324,"How many people really understand what they’re buying, especially when it comes to highly specialized hardware companies? Most NVidia investors seem to be relying on a vague idea of how the company should thrive “in the future”, as their GPUs are ostensibly used for Artificial Intelligence, Cloud, holograms, etc. Having been shocked by how this company is represented in the media, I decided to lay out how this business works, doing my part to fight for reality. With what’s been going on in markets, I don’t like my chances but here goes:

Let’s start with…

**How does NVDA make money?**

NVDA is in the business of semiconductor design. As a simplified image in your head, you can imagine this as designing very detailed and elaborate posters. Their engineers create circuit patterns for printing onto semiconductor wafers. NVDA then pays a semiconductor foundry (the printer – generally TSMC) to create chips with those patterns on them.

Simply put, NVDA’s profits represent the difference between the price at which they can sell those chips, less the cost of printing, and less the cost of paying their engineers to design them.

Notably, after the foundry prints the chips, NVDA also has to pay (I say pay, but really it is more like “sell at a discount to”) their “add-in board” (AIB) partners to stick the chips onto printed circuit boards (what you might imagine as green things with a bunch of capacitors on them). That leads to the final form in which buyers experience the GPU.

**What is a GPU?**

NVDA designs chips called GPUs (Graphical Processing Units). Initially, GPUs were used for the rapid processing and creation of images, but their use cases have expanded over time. You may be familiar with the CPU (Central Processing Unit). CPUs sit at the core of a computer system, doing most of the calculation, taking orders from the operating system (e.g. Windows, Linux), etc. AMD and Intel make CPUs. GPUs assist the CPU with certain tasks. You can think of the CPU as having a few giant very powerful engines. The GPU has a lot of small much less powerful engines. Sometimes you have to do a lot of really simple tasks that don’t require powerful engines to complete. Here, the act of engaging the powerful engines is a waste of time, as you end up spending most of your time revving them up and revving them down. In that scenario, it helps the CPU to hand that task over to the GPU in order to “accelerate” the completion of the task. The GPU only revs up a small engine for each task, and is able to rev up all the small engines simultaneously to knock out a large number of these simple tasks at the same time. Remember the GPU has lots of engines. The GPU also has an edge in interfacing a lot with memory but let’s not get too technical.

**Who uses NVDA’s GPUs?**

There are two main broad end markets for NVDA’s GPUs – Gaming and Professional. Let’s dig into each one:

**The Gaming Market:**

A Bit of Ancient History (**Skip if impatient**)

GPUs were first heavily used for gaming in arcades. They then made their way to consoles, and finally PCs. NVDA started out in the PC phase of GPU gaming usage. They weren’t the first company in the space, but they made several good moves that ultimately led to a very strong market position. Firstly, they focused on selling into OEMs – guys like the equivalent of today’s DELL/HP/Lenovo – , which allowed a small company to get access to a big market without having to create a lot of relationships. Secondly, they focused on the design aspect of the GPU, and relied on their Asian supply chain to print the chip, to package the chip and to install in on a printed circuit board – the Asian supply chain ended up being the best in semis. But the insight that really let NVDA dominate was noticing that some GPU manufacturers were focusing on keeping hardware-accelerated Transform and Lighting as a Professional GPU feature. As a start-up, with no professional GPU business to disrupt, NVidia decided their best ticket into the big leagues was blowing up the market by including this professional grade feature into their gaming product. It worked – and this was a real masterstroke – the visual and performance improvements were extraordinary. 3DFX, the initial leader in PC gaming GPUs, was vanquished, and importantly it happened when funding markets shut down with the tech bubble bursting and after 3DFX made some large ill-advised acquisitions. Consequently 3DFX, went from hero to zero, and NVDA bought them for a pittance out of bankruptcy, acquiring the best IP portfolio in the industry.

**Some more Modern History**

This is what NVDA’s pure gaming card revenue looks like over time – NVDA only really broke these out in 2005 (note by pure, this means ex-Tegra revenues):

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394577731223552/tumblr\_Ikb8g9Cu9sxh2ERno](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394577731223552/tumblr_Ikb8g9Cu9sxh2ERno)

So what is the history here? Well, back in the late 90s when GPUs were first invented, they were **required** to play any 3D game. As discussed in the early history above, NVDA landed a hit product to start with early and got a strong burst of growth: revenues of 160M in 1998 went to 1900M in 2002. But then NVDA ran into strong competition from ATI (later purchased and currently owned by AMD). While NVDA’s sales struggled to stay flat from 2002 to 2004, ATI’s doubled from 1Bn to 2Bn. NVDA’s next major win came in 2006, with the 8000 series. ATI was late with a competing product, and NVDA’s sales skyrocketed – as can be seen in the graph above. With ATI being acquired by AMD they were unfocused for some time, and NVDA was able to keep their lead for an extended period. Sales slowed in 2008/2009 but that was due to the GFC – people don’t buy expensive GPU hardware in recessions.

And then we got to 2010 and the tide changed. Growth in desktop PCs ended. Here is a chart from Statista:

📷[https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394674172919808/tumblr\_OgCnNwTyqhMhAE9r9](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394674172919808/tumblr_OgCnNwTyqhMhAE9r9)

This resulted in two negative secular trends for Nvidia. Firstly, with the decline in popularity of desktop PCs, growth in gaming GPUs faded as well (below is a chart from Jon Peddie). Note that NVDA sells discrete GPUs, aka DT (Desktop) Discrete. Integrated GPUs are mainly made by Intel (these sit on the motherboard or with the CPU).

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394688079200256/tumblr\_rTtKwOlHPIVUj8e7h](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394688079200256/tumblr_rTtKwOlHPIVUj8e7h)

You can see from the chart above that discrete desktop GPU sales are fading faster than integrated GPU sales. This is the other secular trend hurting NVDA’s gaming business. Integrated GPUs are getting better and better, taking over a wider range of tasks that were previously the domain of the discrete GPU. Surprisingly, the most popular eSports game of recent times – Fortnite – only requires Intel HD 4000 graphics – an Integrated GPU from 2012!

So at this point you might go back to NVDA’s gaming sales, and ask the question: What happened in 2015? How is NVDA overcoming these secular trends?

The answer consists of a few parts.Firstly, AMD dropped the ball in 2015. As you can see in this chart, sourced from 3DCenter, AMD market share was halved in 2015, due to a particularly poor product line-up:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394753459994624/tumblr\_J7vRw9y0QxMlfm6Xd](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394753459994624/tumblr_J7vRw9y0QxMlfm6Xd)

Following this, NVDA came out with Pascal in 2016 – a very powerful offering in the mid to high end part of the GPU market. At the same time, AMD was focusing on rebuilding and had no compelling mid or high end offerings. AMD mainly focused on maintaining scale in the very low end. Following that came 2017 and 2018: AMD’s offering was still very poor at the time, but cryptomining drove demand for GPUs to new levels, and AMD’s GPUs were more compelling from a price-performance standpoint for crypto mining initially, perversely leading to AMD gaining share. NVDA quickly remedied that by improving their drivers to better mine crypto, regaining their relative positioning, and profiting in a big way from the crypto boom. Supply that was calibrated to meet gaming demand collided with cryptomining demand and Average Selling Prices of GPUs shot through the roof. Cryptominers bought top of the line GPUs aggressively.

A good way to see changes in crypto demand for GPUs is the mining profitability of Ethereum:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394769378443264/tumblr\_cmBtR9gm8T2NI9jmQ](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394769378443264/tumblr_cmBtR9gm8T2NI9jmQ)

This leads us to where we are today. 2019 saw gaming revenues drop for NVDA. Where are they likely to head?

The secular trends of falling desktop sales along with falling discrete GPU sales have reasserted themselves, as per the Jon Peddie research above. Cryptomining profitability has collapsed.

AMD has come out with a new architecture, NAVI, and the 5700XT – the first Iteration, competes effectively with NVDA in the mid-high end space on a price/performance basis. This is the first real competition from AMD since 2014.

NVDA can see all these trends, and they tried to respond. Firstly, with volumes clearly declining, and likely with a glut of second-hand GPUs that can make their way to gamers over time from the crypto space, NVDA decided to pursue a price over volume strategy. They released their most expensive set of GPUs by far in the latest Turing series. They added a new feature, Ray Tracing, by leveraging the Tensor Cores they had created for Professional uses, hoping to use that as justification for higher prices (more on this in the section on Professional GPUs). Unfortunately for NVDA, gamers have responded quite poorly to Ray Tracing – it caused performance issues, had poor support, poor adoption, and the visual improvements in most cases are not particularly noticeable or relevant.

The last recession led to gaming revenues falling 30%, despite NVDA being in a very strong position at the time vis-à-vis AMD – this time around their position is quickly slipping and it appears that the recession is going to be bigger. Additionally, the shift away from discrete GPUs in gaming continues.

To make matters worse for NVDA, AMD won the slots in both the New Xbox and the New PlayStation, coming out later this year. The performance of just the AMD GPU in those consoles looks to be competitive with NVidia products that currently retail for more than the entire console is likely to cost. Consider that usually you have to pair that NVidia GPU with a bunch of other expensive hardware. The pricing and margin impact of this console cycle on NVDA is likely to be very substantially negative.

It would be prudent to assume a greater than 30% fall in gaming revenues from the very elevated 2019 levels, with likely secular decline to follow.

**The Professional Market:**

A Bit of Ancient History (again, skip if impatient)

As it turns out, graphical accelerators were first used in the Professional market, long before they were employed for Gaming purposes. The big leader in the space was a company called Silicon Graphics, who sold workstations with custom silicon optimised for graphical processing. Their sales were only $25Mn in 1985, but by 1997 they were doing 3.6Bn in revenue – truly exponential growth. Unfortunately for them, from that point on, discrete GPUs took over, and their highly engineered, customised workstations looked exorbitantly expensive in comparison. Sales sank to 500mn by 2006 and, with no profits in sight, they ended up filing for bankruptcy in 2009. Competition is harsh in the semiconductor industry.

Initially, the Professional market centred on visualisation and design, but it has changed over time. There were a lot of players and lot of nuance, but I am going to focus on more recent times, as they are more relevant to NVidia.

**Some More Modern History**

NVDA’s Professional business started after its gaming business, but we don’t have revenue disclosures that show exactly when it became relevant. This is what we do have – going back to 2005:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394785029472256/tumblr\_fEcYAzdstyh6tqIsI](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394785029472256/tumblr_fEcYAzdstyh6tqIsI)

In the beginning, Professional revenues were focused on the 3D visualisation end of the spectrum, with initial sales going into workstations that were edging out the customised builds made by Silicon Graphics. Fairly quickly, however, GPUs added more and more functionality and started to turn into general parallel data processors rather than being solely optimised towards graphical processing.

As this change took place, people in scientific computing noticed, and started using GPUs to accelerate scientific workloads that involve very parallel computation, such as matrix manipulation. This started at the workstation level, but by 2007 NVDA decided to make a new line-up of Tesla series cards specifically suited to scientific computing. The professional segment now have several points of focus:

1. GPUs used in workstations for things such as CAD graphical processing (Quadro Line)
2. GPUs used in workstations for computational workloads such as running engineering simulations (Quadro Line)
3. GPUs used in workstations for machine learning applications (Quadro line.. but can use gaming cards as well for this)
4. GPUs used by enterprise customers for high performance computing (such as modelling oil wells) (Tesla Line)
5. GPUs used by enterprise customers for machine learning projects (Tesla Line)
6. GPUs used by hyperscalers (mostly for machine learning projects) (Tesla Line)

In more recent times, given the expansion of the Tesla line, NVDA has broken up reporting into Professional Visualisation (Quadro Line) and Datacenter (Tesla Line). Here are the revenue splits since that reporting started:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394798232158208/tumblr\_3AdufrCWUFwLgyQw2](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394798232158208/tumblr_3AdufrCWUFwLgyQw2)

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394810632601600/tumblr\_2jmajktuc0T78Juw7](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394810632601600/tumblr_2jmajktuc0T78Juw7)

It is worth stopping here and thinking about the huge increase in sales delivered by the Tesla line. The reason for this huge boom is the sudden increase in interest in numerical techniques for machine learning. Let’s go on a brief detour here to understand what machine learning is, because a lot of people want to hype it but not many want to tell you what it actually is. I have the misfortune of being very familiar with the industry, which prevented me from buying into the hype. Oops – sometimes it really sucks being educated.

**What is Machine Learning?**

At a very high level, machine learning is all about trying to get some sort of insight out of data. Most of the core techniques used in machine learning were developed a long time ago, in the 1950s and 1960s. The most common machine learning technique, which most people have heard of and may be vaguely familiar with, is called regression analysis. Regression analysis involves fitting a line through a bunch of datapoints. The most common type of regression analysis is called “Ordinary Least Squares” OLS regression, and that type of regression has a “closed form” solution, which means that there is a very simple calculation you can do to fit an OLS regression line to data.

As it happens, fitting a line through points is not only easy to do, it also tends to be the main machine learning technique that people want to use, because it is very intuitive. You can make good sense of what the data is telling you and can understand the machine learning model you are using. Obviously, regression analysis doesn’t require a GPU!

However, there is another consideration in machine learning: if you want to use a regression model, you still need a human to select the data that you want to fit the line through. Also, sometimes the relationship doesn’t look like a line, but rather it might look like a curve. In this case, you need a human to “transform” the data before you fit a line through it in order to make the relationship linear.

So people had another idea here: what if instead of getting a person to select the right data to analyse, and the right model to apply, you could just get a computer to do that? Of course the problem with that is that computers are really stupid. They have no preconceived notion of what data to use or what relationship would make sense, so what they do is TRY EVERYTHING! And everything involves trying a hell of a lot of stuff. And trying a hell of a lot of stuff, most of which is useless garbage, involves a huge amount of computation. People tried this for a while through to the 1980s, decided it was useless, and dropped it… until recently.

What changed? Well we have more data now, and we have a lot more computing power, so we figured lets have another go at it. As it happens, the premier technique for trying a hell of a lot of stuff (99.999% of which is garbage you throw away) is called “Deep Learning”. Deep learning is SUPER computationally intensive, and that computation happens to involve a lot of matrix multiplication. And guess what just happens to have been doing a lot of matrix multiplication? GPUs!

Here is a chart that, for obvious reasons, lines up extremely well with the boom in Tesla GPU sales:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394825774989312/tumblr\_IZ3ayFDB0CsGdYVHW](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394825774989312/tumblr_IZ3ayFDB0CsGdYVHW)

Now we need to realise a few things here. Deep Learning is not some magic silver bullet. There are specific applications where it has proven very useful – primarily areas that have a very large number of very weak relationships between bits of data that sum up into strong relationships. An example of ones of those is Google Translate. On the other hand, in most analytical tasks, it is most useful to have an intuitive understanding of the data and to fit a simple and sensible model to it that is explainable. Deep learning models are not explainable in an intuitive manner. This is not only because they are complicated, but also because their scattershot technique of trying everything leaves a huge amount of garbage inside the model that cancels itself out when calculating the answer, but it is hard to see how it cancels itself out when stepping through it.

Given the quantum of hype on Deep learning and the space in general, many companies are using “Deep Learning”, “Machine Learning” and “AI” as marketing. Not many companies are actually generating significant amounts of tangible value from Deep Learning.

**Back to the Competitive Picture**

**For the Tesla Segment**

So NVDA happened to be in the right place at the right time to benefit from the Deep Learning hype. They happened to have a product ready to go and were able to charge a pretty penny for their product. But what happens as we proceed from here?

Firstly, it looks like the hype from Deep Learning has crested, which is not great from a future demand perspective. Not only that, but we really went from people having no GPUs, to people having GPUs. The next phase is people upgrading their old GPUs. It is much harder to sell an upgrade than to make the first sale.

Not only that, but GPUs are not the ideal manifestation of silicon for Deep Learning. NVDA themselves effectively admitted that with their latest iteration in the Datacentre, called Ampere. High Performance Computing, which was the initial use case for Tesla GPUs, was historically all about double precision floating point calculations (FP64). High precision calculations are required for simulations in aerospace/oil & gas/automotive.

NVDA basically sacrificed HPC and shifted further towards Deep Learning with Ampere, announced last Thursday. The FP64 performance of the A100 (the latest Ampere chip) increased a fairly pedestrian 24% from the V100, increasing from 7.8 to 9.7 TF. Not a surprise that NVDA lost El Capitan to AMD, given this shift away from a focus on HPC. Instead, NVDA jacked up their Tensor Cores (i.e. not the GPU cores) and focused very heavily on FP16 computation (a lot less precise than FP64). As it turns out, FP16 is precise enough for Deep Learning, and NVDA recognises that. The future industry standard is likely to be BFloat 16 – the format pioneered by Google, who lead in Deep Learning. Ampere now does 312 TF of BF16, which compares to the 420 TF of Google’s TPU V3 – Google’s Machine Learning specific processor. Not quite up to the 2018 board from Google, but getting better – if they cut out all of the Cuda cores and GPU functionality maybe they could get up to Google’s spec.

And indeed this is the problem for NVDA: when you make a GPU it has a large number of different use cases, and you provide a single product that meets all of these different use cases. That is a very hard thing to do, and explains why it has been difficult for competitors to muscle into the GPU space. On the other hand, when you are making a device that does one thing, such as deep learning, it is a much simpler thing to do. Google managed to do it with no GPU experience and is still ahead of NVDA. It is likely that Intel will be able to enter this space successfully, as they have widely signalled with the Xe.

There is of course the other large negative driver for Deep Learning, and that is the recession we are now in. Demand for GPU instances on Amazon has collapsed across the board, as evidenced by the fall in pricing. The below graph shows one example: this data is for renting out a single Tesla V100 GPU on AWS, which isthe typical thing to do in an early exploratory phase for a Deep Learning model:

With Deep Learning not delivering near-term tangible results, it is the first thing being cut. On their most recent conference call, IBM noted weakness in their cognitive division (AI), and noted weaker sales of their power servers, which is the line that houses Enterprise GPU servers at IBM. Facebook cancelled their AI residencies for this year, and Google pushed theirs out. Even if NVDA can put in a good quarter due to their new product rollout  (Ampere), the future is rapidly becoming a very stormy place.

**For the Quadro segment**

The Quadro segment has been a cash cow for a long time, generating dependable sales and solid margins. AMD just decided to rock the boat a bit. Sensing NVDA’s focus on Deep Learning, AMD seems to be focusing on HPC – the Radeon VII announced recently with a price point of $1899 takes aim at NVDAs most expensive Quadro, the GV100, priced at $8999. It does 6.5 TFLOPS of FP64 Double precision, whereas the GV100 does 7.4 – talk about shaking up a quiet segment.

**Pulling things together**

Let’s go back to what NVidia fundamentally does – paying their engineers to design chips, getting TSMC to print those chips, and getting board partners in Taiwan to turn them into the final product.

We have seen how a confluence of several pieces of extremely good fortune lined up to increase NVidia’s sales and profits tremendously: first on the Gaming side, weak competition from AMD until 2014, coupled with a great product in form of Pascal in 2016, followed by a huge crypto driven boom in 2017 and 2018, and on the Professional side, a sudden and unexpected increase in interest in Deep Learning driving Tesla demand from 2017-2019 sky high.

It is worth noting what these transient factors have done to margins. When unexpected good things happen to a chip company, sales go up a lot, but there are no costs associated with those sales. Strong demand means that you can sell each chip for a higher price, but no additional design work is required, and you still pay the printer, TSMC, the same amount of money. Consequently NVDA’s margins have gone up substantially: well above their 11.9% long term average to hit a peak of 33.2%, and more recently 26.5%:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396192166100992/tumblr\_RiWaD0RLscq4midoP](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396192166100992/tumblr_RiWaD0RLscq4midoP)

The question is, what would be a sensible margin going forward? Obviously 33% operating margin would attract a wall of competition and get competed away, which is why they can only be temporary. However, NVidia has shifted to having a greater proportion of its sales coming from non-OEM, and has a greater proportion of its sales coming from Professional rather than gaming. As such, maybe one can be generous and say NVDA can earn an 18% average operating margin over the next cycle. We can sense check these margins, using Intel. Intel has a long term average EBIT margin of about 25%. Intel happens to actually print the chips as well, so they collect a bigger fraction of the final product that they sell. NVDA, since it only does the design aspect, can’t earn a higher EBIT margin than Intel on average over the long term.

Tesla sales have likely gone too far and will moderate from here – perhaps down to a still more than respectable $2bn per year. Gaming resumes the long-term slide in discrete GPUs, which will likely be replaced by integrated GPUs to a greater and greater extent over time. But let’s be generous and say it maintains $3.5 Bn Per year for the add in board, and let’s assume we keep getting $750mn odd of Nintendo Switch revenues(despite that product being past peak of cycle, with Nintendo themselves forecasting a sales decline). Let’s assume AMD struggles to make progress in Quadro, despite undercutting NVDA on price by 75%, with continued revenues at $1200. Add on the other 1.2Bn of Automotive, OEM and IP (I am not even counting the fact that car sales have collapsed and Automotive is likely to be down big), and we would end up with revenues of $8.65 Bn, at an average operating margin of 20% through the cycle that would have $1.75Bn of operating earnings power, and if I say that the recent Mellanox acquisition manages to earn enough to pay for all the interest on NVDAs debt, and I assume a tax rate of 15% we would have around $1.5Bn in Net income.

This company currently has a market capitalisation of $209 Bn. It blows my mind that it trades on 139x what I consider to be fairly generous earnings – earnings that NVidia never even got close to seeing before the confluence of good luck hit them. But what really stuns me is the fact that investors are actually willing to extrapolate this chain of unlikely and positive events into the future.

Shockingly, Intel has a market cap of 245Bn, only 40Bn more than NVDA, but Intel’s sales and profits are 7x higher. And while Intel is facing competition from AMD, it is much more likely to hold onto those sales and profits than NVDA is. These are absolutely stunning valuation disparities.

If I didn’t see NVDA’s price, and I started from first principles and tried to calculate a prudent price for the company I would have estimated a$1.5Bn normalised profit, maybe on a 20x multiple giving them the benefit of the doubt despite heading into a huge recession, and considering the fact that there is not much debt and the company is very well run. That would give you a market cap of $30Bn, and a share price of $49. And it is currently $339. Wow. Obviously I’m short here!",2020-05-18 07:52:55

Airbnb, DoorDash, Roblox and Wish are all expected to make their filings public by early next week, said people familiar with the matter.

It’s already been a big year for tech IPOs, most notably in September, which was the busiest year on record for the New York Stock Exchange.

Between early and mid-December, public investors will likely get their first crack at buying stock in food delivery provider DoorDash, e-retailer Wish and kids gaming company Roblox, according to people familiar with the matter. Airbnb is also expected to file its prospectus by early next week, putting the home-sharing company in position to hold its market debut after Thanksgiving, said two of the people.

Filings are expected by next week, though the timing could change based on market conditions, said the people, who asked not to be named because their plans are private.

All four companies confidentially filed paperwork with the SEC this year, setting the stage for eventual public offerings. DoorDash announced its submission in February, followed by Airbnb and Wish in August and Roblox in October. Because the virtual roadshow has become commonplace during Covid, companies only need a couple weeks to meet with investors before their debuts.

Representatives from each of the companies declined to comment for this story.

Despite an economic crisis, tech IPOs are red hot, reflecting a sector that has outperformed the market in the face of a global pandemic, which has killed over 240,000 Americans, while investors also navigated the uncertainty of a presidential election. Stocks rallied after Joe Biden’s electoral defeat of President Donald Trump, giving tech companies that were surveying the market further incentive to go out now, said Kelly Rodriques, CEO of pre-IPO marketplace Forge.

The sector’s strong performance has persuaded all four companies to push forward with going public now, before conditions change. About a dozen other global tech companies could raise at least $1 billion in an offering that are preparing for 2021, according to a person familiar with the matter.

“With 180k for 4Q the line in the sand, we believe given the underlying strength we are picking up in China as well as a late push in Europe and the U.S., that 190k-200k is well within reach,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a commentary.

He added that “while there are some logistics speed bumps throughout Europe that could derail a number of deliveries in the next few days, the theme of the Tesla story and overall global EV demand continues to be around white hot demand coming out of China.”

Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy also has a neutral rating on Tesla, with a $400 price target. He forecasts 183,000 deliveries this quarter, above what he sees as the sell-side consensus for 163,000 and the likely buy-side consensus for 175,000 to 180,000 deliveries. That would take Tesla to 502,000 deliveries for 2020 as a whole.

This sub is great to look at DD’s at stocks and to get good stock news. However, it is incredibly ridiculous the amount of posts and comments here asking what x stock is going to do or how the stock market is going to perform next month. I would've thought it would be just the people who are new to the stock market or this subreddit, but there are actually a large number of people here that have been posting/commenting on the subreddit for a while, meaning they aren't new here and they STILL do this. 

However, this isn't even the main problem. The actual problem is the people who reply to these posts/comments and they act like they know what they are talking about so they will say some BS with 100% confidence which probably will influence many of the people who don't know any better. The more you think about it, the more concerning it actually becomes. I don't believe ignorance warrants someone to getting screwed over so just because someone is dumb enough to trust a random redditor and lose money doesn't mean they deserve it. This is very serious stuff since this is literally people's money and I wish more people realized how awful it is that people will come here and look at any advice and dump their money into a random stock and then come back later with major losses.

**I think this even applies to most people on this subreddit but at a more subliminal level**. I have a feeling that there are many people here that still are prone to this, even if they don't blatantly listen to random people. For example, pretty much everyone in this subreddit agreed to not buy anything during March because ""the bottom hasn't come yet"". I have even seen posts asking if the stimulus package would help the stock market and people pretty much agreed that it wasn't going to do much (you can look at the threads if you want). People would reply to these posts with absolute confidence; not a ""probably not"" or ""I don't think so"", but a ""It's not going to do x"". When these posts/comments are constantly upvoted and replicated, this can even influence the people who disagreed, creating a conformity effect based on majority social influence and not factual information. 

I guarantee you there are people here who were interested in buying in March when stocks were at a very low price, looked at this subreddits opinions, and ended up not buying them because the majority of people said not to. When in reality, that would've been the ideal thing to do, and they could've made a lot of money. I don't know how these types of posts and comments are so popular on this subreddit, but they are. I am making this post to remind people of these things, and I don't want the same thing to happen to as many people in the future.",2020-11-22 03:44:01

1301,Musk Sets Sights on Selling 20 Million Teslas by ’27. That Means 70% Annual Growth.,1585,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j1e5th/musk_sets_sights_on_selling_20_million_teslas_by/,247,"Tesla ￼ CEO Elon Musk tweeted Monday morning that his company might sell 20 million cars by 2027 and he sees 30 million electric vehicles sold across the industry.

The numbers are almost too big to contemplate, no matter how investors dissect them, and dissect them they will.

Tesla (ticker: TSLA) is expected to deliver about 141,000 cars in the third quarter of 2020 and 483,000 cars for the full year. That amounts to about 30% growth compared with 2019—an impressive achievement given the global pandemic. Ford Motor ￼ (F) sales, for comparison, are expected to dip about 20% in 2020.

A few numbers were being tweeted. “Seven years for sure to 30 [million plus] new fully electric vehicles per year, six years maybe,” said Musk. “Five years is possible, but unlikely. An extra year makes a giant difference when it comes to exponentials.”

The 20 million stretch goal is more than 40 times higher than this year’s production and works out to an average annual growth rate of roughly 70%. There is precedent. Tesla increased deliveries by about 100% a year on average in the seven years from 2012 to 2019.

But Tesla was starting off a base of fewer than 3,000 cars. What’s more, it invested about $11 billion from 2012 to 2019 to produce more cars. It has become more efficient over time, but raising production to 20 million vehicles could take up to $100 billion. That is a rough estimate and, again, hard to contemplate.

Toyota Motor ￼ (TM) sold about 9 million cars in 2019. It spent roughly $100 billion over the past decade renewing its capacity and retooling plants as new cars were introduced. In the global auto business the numbers are huge.

None of this accounts for the ramp-up in the supply chain that will be required to take EV penetration globally from roughly 2% to 30%, based on Musk’s comments. He spoke to that issue at his company’s Sept. 22 battery technology day. “We’re not getting into the [battery] cell business because we—just for the hell of it,” Musk said. “It’s because it’s the fundamental constraint. It’s the thing that is the limiting factor for rapid growth.""

At the event, Tesla laid out plans to cut battery costs by more than 50%. It also outlined plans to cut the amount of investment required to build new battery capacity by about 75%.

Obviously, 20 million out of 30 million vehicles works out to market share of 67%. Tesla’s share of EV sales in the U.S. was about 55% in 2018 and 2019. Those are the first two years of significant sales of the Model 3, the company’s lower-priced model.

Musk also said he thinks battery improvements will enable the company to profitably sell a $25,000 car. The Model 3 starts at $35,000.

It is worth noting that Tesla achieved 55% share selling cars with an average price of about $75,000. Ford’s average selling price is closer to $30,000 per vehicle.

If Tesla were to reach 20 million sales, it would mean the company is generating, perhaps, $800 billion in sales and $100 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

There is a long way to go to get there. Investors may be inclined to believe Musk. He’s had a good year. Tesla shares are up 387% year to date, as of Friday’s closing price, far better than comparable returns of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Gains have made Tesla the world’s most valuable auto maker.

If you fold at the drop of a hat, then the stock market isn't for you. There will be bad days, but it's up to you as an investor to understand that timing the market is dang near impossible. You need to start thinking long-term if you haven't been doing so already. If you're expecting +50% gains, you're lost dude. 

This isn't r/wallstreetbets so stop saying ""yolo"" and throwing all your money into companies that you're only buying because other people are talking about it. After all, ""most news is noise; not news."" Remember why you're here. Throwing your money into meme stocks is a good way to end up broke. Don't forget that we're still in the midst of a pandemic in a country whose people turned mask-wearing into a political issue. The possibility that we undergo another lockdown isn't outlandish. 

Do research. Read, for crying out loud. Look at earnings reports. Take everything you hear with a grain of salt. Slow and steady money is much better than losses, so act like it.

Airline stocks crashed due to NBC PR's edited interview.,1556,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gjbmry/boeing_ceo_did_not_say_an_airline_would_go/,240,"Starting yesterday, airline stocks have been tanking-- especially today-- under the claim via multiple news sites that Boeing's CEO, David Calhoun, said an airline would ""most likely"" go bankrupt in September-- based on an [interview from Tuesday's Today Show](https://www.today.com/video/boeing-ceo-it-could-take-3-to-5-years-for-airline-industry-to-return-from-apocalyptic-state-83326533868?mod=article_inline).

This is totally misinformation, that has been unfortunately spread by NBC.

What actually happened is that interviewer Savannah Guthrie, gave a long supposition, and asked Calhoun to agree with it:

>GUTHRIE: The money that the government used to bailout the airlines runs out in September, so they are going to have to start laying off people. Do you expect that the airlines to be able to survive this?   Do you think there might be a major U.S. carrier that just has to go out of business?  
>  
>CALHOUN: **Well, I don't want to get too predictive on that subject**, but yes, most likely. You know, something will have to happen when September comes around... 

She put words into his mouth, and asked two different questions at the same time-- the first being an obvious yes, the second should have been a ""no."" He may have already been primed to answer, as indicated by his stumbling response, then merely blurted out, ""but yes, most likely."" 

Before the full interview was released, [NBC News PR edited the segment in a post on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NBCNewsPR/status/1259970858447253505) -- making Calhoun reply, ""Yes, most, likely"" only to the last part, and leaving out the rest of what he said!  

It's a case of unethical editing -- which was then propagated by other sources.

[*USA Today* picked it up](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2020/05/11/boeing-ceo-predicts-major-airline-go-out-business-coronavirus-pandemic/3113292001/?mod=article_inline), sourcing the NBC News PR Twitter edited version.

Based on the *USA Today* story, [Marketwatch repeated the claim](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-major-us-airline-most-likely-will-go-bankrupt-boeing-ceo-says-in-interview-2020-05-12)

Reuters, usually a trustworthy source, [further spread the misquote](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-boeing-airlines/boeing-ceo-sees-passenger-levels-under-25-in-september-pain-for-airlines-nbc-interview-idUSKBN22N31M) which ended up getting reprinted in multiple places.

A writer at *Forbes* then amped the claim, saying Calhoun ""[responded quickly and strongly, “Yes, most likely.”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/willhorton1/2020/05/12/boeing-ceo-expects-airline-bankruptcy--what-did-he-really-mean-about-coronavirus-impacts/#6c79022d344a)

*Barron's* [similarly spread the news](https://www.barrons.com/articles/boeing-calhoun-airlines-bankruptcy-credit-default-swaps-51589294871): ""Boeing Predicts an Airline Bankruptcy.""

Boeing had to put out a statement about Calhoun's quote, via spokesman Gordon Johndroe: “He was speaking to the general uncertainty in the sector, not about any one particular airline.” But it was too late -- the damage was already being done to all the industry components.

What was Calhoun thinking, showing up on the TODAY show for an interview, as a new CEO? There was no benefit to his company. The pulled quote has now cost billions of dollars in lost market cap for all the major airlines, which means they have less financial resources to buy from Boeing.",2020-05-14 11:34:21
1309,Apple Launches New iPhones Tuesday. Wall Street Is Pumped,1546,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j9udf4/apple_launches_new_iphones_tuesday_wall_street_is/,276,"Tuesday is the day. After many months of investor buildup, Apple is finally about to unveil the first generation of 5G iPhones, which likely will be called iPhone 12.

The details have been widely leaked. Apple ￼ (ticker: AAPL) is expected to unveil four models. Here’s how Raymond James analyst Chris Caso laid it out in a research note last month:

• iPhone 12, with a 5.4-inch screen, priced at $699

• iPhone 12 Max, with a 6.1-inch screen, priced at $799

• iPhone 12 Pro, also with a 6.1-inch screen, plus higher end cameras, priced at $999

• iPhone 12 Pro Max, with a 6.6-inch screen, priced at $1,099

There is also some speculation about new Apple-branded over-the-ear headphones called AirPods Studio, and perhaps a new product for tracking things with Bluetooth called AirTags. But there’s no question that this event is all about the iPhone, and the expectations are sky high.

Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives writes this morning that this will be the most important Apple iPhone product cycle since the iPhone 6 in 2014. That time, Apple finally moved beyond 4-inch displays—the iPhone 6 was 4.7 inches and the beloved iPhone 6s a whopping 5.5 inches.

All of the new phones will run on 5G networks. (No coincidence that the tag line for the event is “Hi, Speed.”) Ives notes that the Pro versions are expected to have Lidar sensor technology, useful for augmented reality applications, as well as enhanced rear-camera technology. Ives expects preorders to kick off in a few weeks, with two of the models shipping later this month and the other two in mid-to-late November.

Ives says the U.S. version of the phones will be capable of accessing speedy millimeter wave version of 5G, which he thinks “could be a game changer looking ahead as more infrastructure, technology and apps are built around this transformational 5G highway over the coming years.”

Ives is particular bullish on the prospect for the new phones in China—he thinks the country will account for 20% of upgrades over the coming year.

“With 5G now in the cards and roughly 40% of [the]...iPhone installed base not upgrading their phones in the last 3.5 years, [Apple CEO Tim] Cook & Co. have the stage set for a supercycle 5G product release, which should drive shares further,” he writes. “Although the soft macro and Covid backdrop will clearly dent some demand, we believe the underlying growth drivers for iPhone 12 success are unparalleled for Cupertino.”

Ives maintains his Outperform rating and $150 price target.

Meanwhile, RBC Capital analyst Robert Muller on Monday repeated his Outperform rating, while lifting his price target on Apple stock to $132 from $111. Muller writes that he thinks the new iPhone lineup will “kick off a significant replacement cycle which we believe will be a multiyear process as new applications and spectrum become available over time.”

Muller is also bullish about Apple’s push into the fitness category with the pending launch of the Fitness+ service. “We view Apple’s upcoming Fitness+ offering as a worthwhile competitor within the Health and Wellness category, and expect the service will benefit from pandemic-related at-home spending trends,” he writes. “In addition to meaningful revenue/EPS contribution, we expect notable synergy opportunities across Watch/TV/iPad/Services and view the offering as one more way that Apple can drive customer loyalty and, importantly, repeat purchases.”

Assuming a 20% adoption rate by Apple Watch customers, Muller estimates that Fitness+ could generate $3 billion in annual revenue by 2022. “Our revenue estimates are stand-alone for Fitness+; however, Apple Watch is a requirement and unit sales could benefit from interest in Fitness+,” he writes.  “In total, we view Fitness+ as an ideal candidate to drive additional Apple-related spend and, importantly, keep customers more engaged and immersed within the Apple ecosystem, which should drive future iPhone sales.”

During the press conference Trump said it was being provided by google with a team of over a thousand engineers getting it working.

Google/Alphabet now is denying all of this with a clarification after the press conference.  Alphabet's subsidiary Verily is just working on screening in a pilot in San Francisco and didn't know at all what the press conference was talking about:

>We are developing a tool to help triage individuals for Covid-19 testing. Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time.

Source with more details:

https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179118/google-coronavirus-testing-screening-website-drive-thru-covid-19

Leave aside the Google/Alphabet distinction that they mention one time in the article (which is nitpicky for clickbait), and look at this:

>Carolyn Wang, communications lead for Verily, told The Verge that the “triage website” was initially only going to be made available to health care workers instead of the general public. Now that it has been announced the way it was, however, anybody will be able to visit it, she said. But the tool will only be able to direct people to “pilot sites” for testing in the Bay Area, though Wang says Verily hopes to expand it beyond California “over time.”

That's the website they promoted during the press conference, and ""now that it has been announced the way it was"" indicates they didn't coordinate with them on the announcement at all.

But in late June 2017, Smith poured $10,000 of savings into Tesla’s stock. He said it was the first time he’d ever invested in a company. That was just the start. Each paycheck, Smith, a video producer, would pay his bills and then buy additional shares with the rest, ultimately putting about $90,000 into the volatile stock.

Laura Goldman, 62, says New York-based analysts missed how much appeal the company holds for a younger generation that’s deeply worried about the climate crisis. Goldman, a former stockbroker, doesn’t even own a car — let alone a Tesla. She bought 300 of the company’s shares in the fall of 2010, a few months after its IPO, and picked up more stock over time.

Termanini invested in the company a few months after the June 2010 IPO and says his investment has grown to over $2.5 million, between options and stock. He has traded over the years but he’s not selling now, a decision that’s made easier by the fact that he has a diversified portfolio.

We have created spreadsheets to screen stocks and track our portfolios. We spent weekends working on automating them and making them usable for everyone here (inspired by u/mau2509’s awesome spreadsheet - thanks for sharing here!).

Here is the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AIC22xJtitg8leYTOsIYUBXgzIBAm6gAi8EccViEGrY/edit#gid=0)

You can go to *“File” > “Make a copy”* to save it. *Gray cells are the ones that take user input*, all other ones are automatically filled out.

There are 3 tables in the spreadsheet (all in “Main” sheet):

1. **“Purchased”**: enter the stock tickers you own with the number of shares. This helps you look at the total value of your position in a stock, total portfolio value and how much % is in each stock.
2. **“Investment Tracker”**: enter your desired % allocation for each category (US stocks, International Stocks, Bonds) if you don’t like the default values. We find this useful to take into consideration how diversified our portfolio is before making buy/sell decisions, so that our portfolio is more robust to downturns specific to a certain category.
3. **“Decision Making”**: enter any stock ticker you’re screening to buy/sell. It will automatically fill out several metrics: current price; category and sector; total return over 1, 3, 5, 10 years; recommendation; 30-day trend; current, average and maximum P/E ratio (w/ % of how far the current value is from the average and from max); VWAP; RSI; current and forecasted EPS.

We added comments to explain most metrics and color-coded based on our subjective opinions on what numbers are good/bad for buying decisions (green for good, red for bad, yellow for neutral). You can also use this sheet for selling decisions with different conditions.

The “**Decision Making**” table can be used independently of the other ones for stock screening.

1323,IMPORTANT: proposed SEC filing that will affect you,1499,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hs19jm/important_proposed_sec_filing_that_will_affect_you/,99,"Repost from /u/Particular-Wedding 

If you use 13F filing data in your investing research then please take a few minutes to read this important message.
You may have already seen the SEC proposal https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed.shtml?__s=cvwgmhfkxsnsnrbvs6py to dramatically raise the required reporting threshold for 13F filings.  

This proposal would change the AUM threshold that investment managers must meet every quarter from $100 million to $3.5 billion!  

To put it in perspective, for the most recent quarter, that would reduce the number of funds that disclosed their holdings to the public from 5,283 to 549 or almost 90% of all filers.  $2.3 trillion in investment holdings would no longer be disclosed to the public resulting in loss of transparency and valuable insight.  When Congress first adopted Section 13(f) it did so to “stimulate a higher degree of confidence among all investors in the integrity of [the US] securities markets.”  Taking this data away will have the opposite effect.  Transparency is what gives investors confidence in US markets.

One SEC commissioner, Allison Heren Lee, has already voiced her opposition to this proposal.  https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-13f-reporting-2020-07-10
The proposed rule change would be a loss for all of us - it would enable more corruption and opaqueness.

The SEC should be pushing for more disclosure and transparency and not rolling back existing rules. This can only hurt small trades/investors and provides little to no benefit or savings.

Comments are already pouring into the SEC.  I am urging everyone to please post a comment on the proposal to the SEC site linked below.  Why should we care?  How are we impacted by this?  Below are some issues to raise.  Please mention them in your comments to the SEC and to your representative in Congress:
Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will reduce public companies' opportunity to know more about who their shareholders are.
​
 

-	The “justification” for the rule change is highly questionable.
-	When is less transparency and less data ever a good thing for the small investor
-	Some investors may want to avoid over-owned stocks, believing they have a high level of risk. This rule change greatly reduces individual investors ability to reduce their risk.
-	In the event of a significant correction the number of reporting managers would be diminished even further.  The S&P suffered a 56.4% decline during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  A similar event using the most recent quarter as an example, would have reduced the number of funds by another 31% at a time when such data is needed even more.

And am curious if anyone echoes this sentiment, or if they have had a better experience working with the software...

EDIT: There is an overwhelming amount of ""advice"" about investing in this company, which is fine, but the point of this thread is to gather user experience to determine what the sentiment is of boots on the ground. Part of my due diligence about this company is finding out how the users like it, not hearing the same regurgitated $1000 in 1 year garbage, or ""it's a sure thing"".

I would urge anyone with experience using it to be critical, as I think the comments going against everyones confirmation bias are likely the most important.

EDIT EDIT: It's really unfortunate that people are downvoting critical comments of the software, as those are exactly the types of comments this thread is meant to be embracing. Before you downvote, try and wrap your head around the context of the thread. I would also say, that downvoting things that oppose your confirmation bias is VERY revealing about the state of this sub and others - anyone should see that as alarming.

EDIT EDIT EDIT: It's interesting to note that those two comments have a significant number of upvotes since I have referenced them. It's hard to reconcile the overwhelming positivity in this thread with the echoed sentiment on those comments. Something just doesn't add up to me. It tells me that more people entering this thread are of the opinion that the software isn't all it is cracked up to be, but the comments here don't match.

A user (u/eqpofr) had asked in a comment sure to get buried:

""Can commenters state in what context they used the software, and what their main tasks were, in addition to whether they liked the software or not? Context matters a lot and it's lacking in the discourse I'm seeing here""

I agree that that information is important.",2021-01-19 02:59:56

1326,Tesla Is Now Worth $400 Billion,1486,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ihc9q7/tesla_is_now_worth_400_billion/,508,"The world’s most valuable car company just hit another milestone.

Tesla ￼’s (ticker: TSLA) market capitalization on Wednesday topped $400 billion. About two months ago, it was celebrating $200 billion. It first hit $100 billion in January.

Tesla passed Johnson & Johnson ￼ (JNJ) along the way on Wednesday, in terms of market cap. There are only seven companies in the S&P 500 index worth more, including Visa ￼ (V) at $447 billon and Apple ￼ (AAPL) at $2.16 trillion.

There is a lot you could buy for $400 billion. Here are a few notable   comparisons to put that figure in context.

It’s more than the combined value of every team in the four major U.S. professional sports, according to Forbes estimates. It’s also more than the Forbes estimate for the combined net worth of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Tesla’s own CEO Elon Musk.

It’s nearly four times International Business Machines ￼’ (IBM) market cap.

You could buy 400 billion things at a dollar store—or just buy Dollar General ￼ (DG) and Dollar Tree ￼ (DLTR).

It’s also more than the individual gross domestic product of Israel, Ireland, and Hong Kong.

With $400 billion, you could also stockpile about 181 billion regular gallons of gas, based on AAA’s U.S. estimates. You could drive 5.79 trillion miles, if you averaged 32 miles per gallon. That would take you around the Earth 232.5 million times.

If you are into electric vehicles, $400 billion could get you 10.53 million of Tesla’s basic 2020 Model 3. Of course, such a sale would cause price targets to soar. And Tesla would need a few more factories to turn out that many vehicles. The company only delivered about 90,000 vehicles in the second quarter.

Intro:

> If all goes according to plan, Thomas Healy, 28, will become America’s youngest self-made billionaire next week

Excerpts:

> According to SEC filings, Healy will be the biggest shareholder, with 22.9% of the company, or 34.97 million shares, worth nearly $1.5 billion. 

> He may not be as slick as the other billionaire electric truck impresarios Elon Musk or Nikola’s disgraced former CEO Trevor Milton, but Healy has one up on both Tesla and Nikola when it comes to getting revolutionary tech onto the road. There are already 20 trucks operating with Hyliion’s electric powertrains, built via ventures with Dana Corp. and Volvo. Tesla said this year it was delaying production of its Semi until 2021. Shares in Nikola meanwhile have collapsed from the $70s to less than $20 amid fraud allegations and the departure of Milton.

Also:

> Healy’s e-axle evolved into a complete drivetrain system that Hyliion calls the Hypertruck ERX. Replacing the diesel engine is a bank of electric batteries, which are charged via onboard generators that run on tanks of compressed natural gas. Healy’s approach contrasts with the field’s first movers, including Tesla and its all-electric, battery-centric approach, as well as Nikola, which aims to power its batteries using hydrogen fuel cells.

And:

> Automotive parts giant Dana Inc. in March 2019 made an equity investment into Hyliion, and together they are manufacturing and marketing the device to Dana’s slate of customers, including truck giants Volvo, Navistar and Peterbilt. Today truck makers install engines from Cummins and transmissions from Allison. Hyliion hopes to someday join that echelon.

Starbucks added the Impossible Breakfast Sandwich, made with Impossible plant-based sausage, to its U.S menu on Tuesday to meet the growing customer interest in plant-based options.

Impossible Foods CFO David Lee told CNBC that 9 out of 10 Impossible buyers are traditional meat eaters, bolstered by recent events like the meat shortages from the Covid-19 pandemic and a recent expansion into 1,000 grocery stores.

US stocks fell to their lowest level in two weeks, with the shares of major technology companies under pressure for the second day, due to concerns that valuations were too high for this year's performance.

The declines of Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook pushed the Nasdaq 100, the index of the 100 largest non-financial companies, down more than 5%, although it reduced those losses by more than half as the day progressed and investors found bargains. The broader market fared better, with the S&P 500 index dropping just over 1% in the afternoon.

US Treasury yields increased while the dollar remained stable. Oil dropped to less than $ 40 a barrel for the first time in a month.

According to Bloomberg, Friday's biggest sales appeared to stem from concerns that the recent surge in technology stocks was not linked to broad investor sentiment, but instead would have been driven by overseas options trading. a company.

The Financial Times reported that SoftBank bought billions of dollars in technology derivatives before the crash that started Thursday.

Traders are looking to find an appropriate valuation for technology stocks and assess the health of the US economy as the coronavirus pandemic progresses after killing more than 180,000 Americans.

While the tech industry is generating huge profits during lockdowns, there is also evidence that high-profile companies are overbought.

Elsewhere, emerging market stocks fell for the third day. European stocks plunged. Asian stocks fell, with the Australian index registering the biggest drop since May. Meanwhile, the Ibovespa faced declines of more than 3%, and risks losing 100,000 points again.

I know these are not likely worth anything, but I’m genuinely curious. From what I can tell in my quick internet searching, the company no longer exists in the same structure of the time of the share purchase (acquisition possibly). 

I’ve found a couple sites that you can pay ~$50 for experts to do some deep research and track down their current worth. Anyone have experience doing their own research on older paper stocks or recommendations for a good service?

***Edit 1 to add company info. 

The company is Plough Inc, which looks to have eventually merged under Merck. I’ve reached out to Merck’s Transfer Agent (based on rec’s from google). Will update here as I make progress.

***Edit 2 
I appreciate all the interest! No definite answers yet, but hoping to hear back from a Merck rep in the next few days. 

As of now, here are my thoughts from my digging and combined effort of the powers of reddit: 
- My certificate states exactly 2 shares purchased in 1948 for Plough Inc. between all of the mergers and share splits, I could be up to 5 shares of current Merck value (~$83/share)
- Theres a high possibility I will run into a barrier with the certificate being in my great-grandfathers name. This will likely cause major issues on trying to claim dividends lost to unclaimed property. I also have no clue how long dividends were collected originally. Curious to see if the name piece is an issue in redeeming current stock value. 

This won’t be a huge windfall either way - a few hundred $$ at the most unless I’m missing some major splits early on.",2020-06-09 05:19:50

Sorry I'm a little late with this post. I know many of you have been asking me to share my stock picks for Q2/Q3 2020. Here are a few stocks in my portfolio.

It's also important to note that 90% of my portfolio is in index funds and blue chip stocks. Growth stocks are high-risk speculative investments, and I generally don't swing more than 3-5% of my cash into these trades.

I've made significant gains on all 3 and I've started to trim my holdings to lock in profits, but figured I'd share info on these companies since there are hardly any posts on them on Reddit.

1344,I'm happy to admit that I'm a total idiot,1387,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/h9n8zp/im_happy_to_admit_that_im_a_total_idiot/,305,"I'm not trying to pass as a genius or savvy investor at all but most of my positions have been up. I started investing in mid June 2016 and there was a time I dipped into 3x leveraged ETFs like JNUG hoping to make quick bucks. I failed and lost a bit of money (about $3000). Back then I read charts like crazy, trying to predict the trend, looking to the Fed minutes, etc. Guess what? One day I was sure that my positions would go up and when the Fed released their statement, it went down.

I was sick of it. In the very beginning, I invested in AMD, NVIDIA, APPLE, and TWITTER. During all that time I toiled over fundamentals, charts, etc, those stocks steadily climbed. I realized had I not trying to get rich quick, I would be in far better position with those simple blue chip stocks. 

So I changed the way I invest.

I stopped paying too much attention to the news. I stopped reading annual reports, I don't care what the fundamentals are, I wouldn't give a damn if the apocalypse hit tomorrow. Candlesticks, earning, financial statements are all meaningless.

I buy and DCA (Dollar cost average) everything. Every paycheck I set aside a certain amount and put into stocks and ETF

This is my current portfolio

AMD, NVDA, APPL, MSFT, VOO, VTI, SPY, SCHG, VGT, XLK, FINX, QQQ, QTEC, FTEC, ESPO, SMH, MGK.

If you think ""ha, this idiot actually bought SPY and VOO, they are the same shit""

Yes, that's why I admitted I'm an idiot. Perhaps a lucky idiot. The only stock that I lost money is SQ. I bought it at all time high in 2018 and the stock went nearly sideway in 2019 so I sold it at a loss of $200 and invested that money into something else. All of my positions have been going up.

Sometimes I tried to dabble into options trading after seeing mad gains from wallstreetbet. 

The main problem: again, I'm an idiot. A happy idiot in fact. No matter how much I read/watch YT videos, I don't understand theta, delta, exercise, short leg, long leg, time value, intrinsic value, strike price. Ok, I do understand the definitions but I don't know how they can connect to each other to make me money. 

So I dropped option trading completely, not even attempt to do anything about it

My portfolio hit all time low on March 20 at -17.33%, today it hit all time high at 18%. It climbed about 40% for the past 3 months

All due to DCA. I steadily put money into stock every 2 weeks. I don't care if the market hit all time high or all time low, I buy. When RH crashed and everyone freaked out, it didn't affect me one bit. 

When I read the story about that guy who took his life over 700k loss, I realize it could be me had I not learn anything from the early $3000 loss. I don't do well with stress. I want to go home after work at night, check my stocks for 5 minutes, eat something, fap, and go to bed. I don't ever want to stress out every minutes of my life over things I can't control: the market.

I don't try to give anyone advice because I'm still a learner. All I ever do is to expand my portfolio and put some more money every paycheck.

But before you buy any book or subscribe to any stock-picking or teaching service, do you realize that stocks picked by a monkey can beat the market?

https://www.stockinvestor.com/35446/beating-market-surprise-surprise-monkeys-win/

I wouldn't waste money in any of that. Every penny I'm not putting into stock is a penny I lose from profit.

1348,"""Big 3"" investing has NOT beat the S&P500 in the past 25 years",1371,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g7zknd/big_3_investing_has_not_beat_the_sp500_in_the/,133,"I was interested in the other thread about big N investing. See that thread for details.

I redid the calculations taking into accounts stock splits & dividend reinvestments for both individual companies and the S&P500.

I wrote a program to do the calculations and ran it for 5 strategies, picking the top N largest market cap company by year for a $1000 investment. I used the same methodologies as the other article, except I stopped in 2018 as I didn't have readily available in my database for the last two years for the S&P500.

Here is the plot of the strategies over time from 1996 to 2018.

And here is the breakdown of holdings in the top N portfolios over that time range.

Conclusion: This relationship that was observed was an anomaly of one of the largest corporations on the market having very large returns in the past 15 years, notable MSFT. 

But when you account for the fact that tech stocks that have been high lately pay very low dividends, and the rest of the S&P pay higher dividends, you find the returns are comparable, yet what is significant is that the risk adjusted returns are not close to comparable. You are far more likely to buy losers and be exposed to portfolio risk by putting significant wealth into single companies. You might buy GE or XOM and never grab the next MSFT. The index fund gives you nearly the same return, and does it without the risk.


Edit: I re-ran the calculations using inflation adjusted investment values ($1000 in 1996 and increasing by CPI for each year thereafter). Used https://www.minneapolisfed.org/about-us/monetary-policy/inflation-calculator/consumer-price-index-1913- for CPI data.

The S&P500 seems to pull farther ahead when you account for inflation. I don't know if this is significant or just related to this one particular example.

Edit2: I redid the analysis using rebalancing. The formula sells its entire portfolio at the start of each year and distributes the funds across the top N companies by market cap at that point. (I used inflation adjusted investment additions)

Here is the first graph: https://i.imgur.com/CkvYu1h.png

You can see that all top N portfolios beat the S&P 500, some by a lot. If you were to have implemented this in your IRA you'd see these results.

This next graph pretends that you held each asset for exactly 1 year and paid long term capital gains tax on the gains of 15%.

And lastly here is the graph that assumes you are paying short term capital gains taxes, and those are roughly 24%.

The impact of the coronavirus-induced economic shutdown tore through the U.S. labor market in April at historic levels, slashing 20.5 million workers from nonfarm payrolls and sending the unemployment rate skyrocketing to 14.7%, the Labor Department reported Friday.

Both numbers easily smashed post-World War II era records and help reflect the profound damage done through efforts used to combat the virus.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting payrolls to shed 21.5 million and the unemployment rate to go to 16%. April’s unemployment rate topped the post-war record 10.8% but was short of the Great Depression high estimated at 24.9%. The financial crisis peak was 10% in October 2009.

1359,Newer investors: Be careful about chasing hype. Come up with a plan.,1315,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k21qbk/newer_investors_be_careful_about_chasing_hype/,398,"Just wanted to put my thoughts out there before markets open for what it's worth.  Full disclosure, I do own PLTR along with EV stocks outside of TSLA.  They currently only make up less than 10% of my portfolio.

The rally that we have seen this week has been impressive.  I imagine for traders this was an incredible week and a lot of money was made.  Hats off to you guys and cheers.  I've learned that there are many ways to win on the market, and trading is certainly one of them.  I'm not one to say that it's a horrible way to approach the markets just because it doesn't work or sit well with me.  That said, for those who are interested in TRADING, this post may not apply as much to you.

However, for those who are thinking about INVESTING.  Please tread carefully.  Ask yourself these questions

1. Do you know what the company does / is hoping to achieve?
2. How does that sit with you?  Do you agree with the company's goals?
3. What, if anything, would change your decision?  What are factors that you believe will prevent the company from doing what it intends to do?
4. Given that you have a sense of the company's achievements, goals, and plans for the future, are you okay with paying what it's currently worth?

At least take some time to answer some of these questions before moving forward.  Similarly come up with a plan for investing your money.  Establish how much you intend to put in the company (i.e. 300 dollars).  If you are concerned that you are buying, for example, PLTR at its all time highs and that it will dip next week, start a position 1/3th position today and come up with a plan to invest the other 2/3 over the next two weeks.  That way if it does dip, you catch some of the dip, but if it does continue to go up for two more weeks, you at least caught some of the initial price/gain.  Either way, at least, by starting a 1/3rd position you can satisfy your FOMO and adjust your plan accordingly from there.

At the end of the day, tread carefully.  Take as much emotion out of the equation as possible.  If your decision to invest is completely based on speculation, then acknowledge that and make sure even that is part of your plan.  I generally encourage every investor to leave some room for spec. plays, but only to the extent that every dollar you invest is all accounted for.  Remember the fundamental fact that by buying a company's stocks you are buying into that company.  Trust me, there will always be more opportunities to make money in the markets.  Right now it's PLTR.  A few days ago it was everything EV, few months ago it was all BioTech, a few months before that it was chip stocks.

Best of luck and may we all come out as winners in one way or another.",2020-11-28 01:09:04

But when the Fed started cutting rates in 2019, I got annoyed with the declining rates and decided it was time to learn about stock investing. 

I slowly bought starting last November and put in most of my money between March and June when the market was tanking. Through a simple strategy of picking blue-chip stocks, indexed ETFs, portfolio diversification, (and staying off Wall Street Bets), I am up 15% in one year, netting about $11,000 in profits when I would have gotten a fraction of that. Part of it was fortunate timing no doubt. 

My big winners have been NVDA 83% up, AMZN 79%, CMG 74% and BABA 63% and the low-cost ETFs I use to further diversify are QQQ, VOT, MGK, VGLT, VTWO and VWO. I learned hard lessons on BA 56%, PCG46% and INTC 27%. 

The biggest advice is would give to new investors is don't get greedy by chasing huge overnight gains with YOLO bets using options and leverage. Find well-run companies that you can hold long-term, make sure you don't overweight into certain sectors (I am guilty of this with amount of tech I hold), and you should be able to earn yourself steady returns. If you're afraid of jumping in because you think the market is at an all-time high, buy-in using DCA.

Today, I am posting about Palantir. Might be a little late posting about this, I bought in around $10 which is their IPO price. Here's a couple reasons why I believe in the long term success of this company.

* Big name backers like Peter Theil.
* Big data/AI analysis. I don't own any stocks in this industry aside from your typical FAANG stocks. This is an opportunity to consolidate my positions into a more focused strategy. I also get to invest in government and defense stocks at the same time.
* Palantir is not just a government and defense stock. Palantir is already expanding to enterprise applications. I believe that this is where our future in society is moving towards. We have made significant progress in technology in the past 20-50 years. We spent so much time and money developing and rushing out newer technologies and in the mad rush we forgot to optimize. There is so much room to use AI and machine learning to figure out where the inefficiencies lies.
* This kind of proprietary tech has a huge moat. It's not something that any competitor can just come and replicate. Their technology is advanced enough to attract attention from the government and companies like General Motors. Having also worked in the industry, I can tell that their tech is way more advanced than their competitors.

As always, only invest what you can lose and you are ultimately responsible for managing your own risk!

EDIT: This post surprisingly caught wind. I'm glad that some of you share the same views about PLTR as I do, I am also glad some of you are expressing skepticism. I love discussing companies and general stocks.

With that in mind, please remember to do your own DD and don't blindly follow strangers! If you're new, please start small and take the time to learn.

I also got questions and DMs asking me to evaluate certain stocks/industries. If it's anything other than what I've posted or am holding, it is likely that i unfortunately would not be able to give you a proper DD on it and can only respond on my gut feelings.

1. Markets sold off before the election on the apparent theory that it was looking to be close/contested and the markets don't like uncertainty.
2. Markets rebounded in the days leading up to the election as it started looking better for a clear Biden win.
3. Election is incredibly close and contested, government will likely be split, and yet the markets are rallying super hard.  The prevailing theory is that a Biden win with Republican senate will make it less likely that Biden will attack big tech and increase taxes.
4. In spite of (3), a split government will also make it more difficult to pass a stimulus package, which increases the likelihood of a double-dip recession.
5. COVID still spiking but nobody seems to care anymore, which makes it more powerful as a potential risk.  If the numbers keep spiking, eventually that will lead to one of two headlines that people really won't like: hospitals getting overwhelmed and/or increasing lockdowns.  The latter will be much more likely to happen under Biden than Trump.
6. The rally today seems broader but there were some real breadth concerns yesterday.  Breadth indicators, like the TICK and NYAD, were flat yesterday.  This suggests the rally is being driven primarily by a certain segment of the market (big tech) and not an ""everything is great, pile into the markets"" sentiment.
7. The ridiculously sharp rally over the past few days has made it extremely difficult to find good entry points on anything.  Stocks have gone from pullback to mega-overbought in 3 days.  Major indices are more extended beyond their 8-day EMAs than since late Nov 2018, shortly before the markets plummeted to major lows.
8. I've learned several valuable lessons over my years of investing that all seem to be coming into conflict right now: i) Time in the market is better than timing the market; ii) Think long term and focus on weekly charts; iii) Don't make emotional, reactionary decisions; iv) Don't get caught up in FOMO; v) Don't invest based on what you think the market will do, or what you want it to do, but on what it's actually doing.

The company is set to be added to the index, which is the broadest measure of the stock market, on December 21, and since the inclusion was announced last month investors have pushed the stock to record highs of $641.76 per share growing the market cap by $221.49 billion.

A surging stock price is hitting short-sellers hard, including Jim Chanos who is one of Wall Street's most skilled betters against companies. Last week he disclosed in an interview he is no longer short the company while offering rare praise to Musk.

DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) announced today that on December 28, 2020, it was awarded a $22.5 million, one-year contract in partnership with SOMPO Holdings for the “Real Data Platform for Security, Health, and Wellbeing”. SOMPO’s visionary Real Data Platform, or “RDP” is a collaborative ecosystem between public and private sectors that will improve healthcare in Japan, streamline supply chains across industries, and increase security and resilience in the region.

In November 2019, SOMPO and Palantir jointly established Palantir Technologies Japan K.K., a technology company that would provide Palantir’s platforms and services in Japan. Already, Palantir Japan has actively supported elder care transformation, with active work across dozens of facilities to make care plans more efficient and effective and improve facility operations.

SOMPO’s RDP objectives will accelerate the digital transformation of Japanese commercial and governmental institutions, and create connected infrastructure across key industries. Japanese industries, ranging from healthcare to automotive to manufacturing, have generated a tremendous amount of “real data” over the past few decades. For example, Japan alone has more than 60,000 elder care facilities, each generating real data from suppliers, facilities, care plans, training programs, and more. The RDP, with SOMPO at the forefront, will serve as the connected infrastructure for this and other industries, including logistics, transportation, research, and government agencies.

Further updates on the RDP will be provided in a forthcoming joint press release between SOMPO and Palantir.",2021-01-04 23:07:04

What money can't buy is TIME, make sure you are happy during your time as you will get older and value less what money you have and value more what TIME you have left. Don't chase the lambo, chase the feeling of happiness. A lambo may not make you happy if you lost all your life chasing it. Don't get addicted to risky trades as they will bite you in the ass (if only that) if you don't play safe.

A good old cabrio at 25  may give you more endorphines than a lambo at 55. Balance is the key. Don't waste your life by chasing the money, don't waste all your money either by chasing the pleasures of life as they will not last if you lose it all",2020-06-11 20:03:43
1387,Apple [AAPL] Stock Price Predictions | Buy or Sell AAPL? Apple [AAPL] Stock Price Target & Analysis,1241,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kmp7x1/apple_aapl_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/,362,"**Should you buy Apple stock or has the company run out of growth opportunities? What is my price prediction for Apple in the next years? Read until the end as I reveal my price target for Apple and also what I think will happen in the next couple of days, weeks & months!**

**\~ Warning! Very Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone! So, let’s go over some of the latest news on Apple before moving on to some fundamental and technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years.

So, let’s start with the [news](https://postimg.cc/Xrkwk6rP) that Apple will cut the App Store commission in half for small app developers starting in the next days, this will affect developers who earn less than $1M annually from the App Store Sales. This is likely to lead to a small decline in commission revenues for Apple as around 98% of the app developers will qualify for this tax reduction from 30% to 15%, but all these small developers only contribute to about 5% of the estimated $50B in annual revenues from the App Store, so that would be only a $1.25B loss for the company, that is less than half a % of the company’s total net sales in the last fiscal year.

Also, these changes may lead to a potential long-term revenue boost, as it is likely this will lead to an increasing creation of apps which will generate more commissions in return.

Alongside this we also saw the company releasing the new MacBook’s with their first in-house [chip](https://postimg.cc/vc39NF7x), which promises faster video and imaging processing [times](https://postimg.cc/CR5Fmj5V), with both [CPU](https://postimg.cc/Y4yLdrMd) and [GPU](https://postimg.cc/xJz8gLsd) performance up to 2 times faster than the latest PC laptop chip using just a fraction of the power consumption, with both of the macbooks promising big improvements in [battery](https://postimg.cc/1fp6y1rz) life. Apple is also [expected](https://postimg.cc/GHrtJ8vc) to roll out even more in-house chips in future products, as they have started the 2-year breakup with Intel chips.

We also saw Morgan Stanley [upgrading](https://postimg.cc/bZ5qMsSS) their base case to $191 at the end of November, as they have cited record lead times, supply chain forecasts and carriers demand as they expect that the company will sell around 270M iPhone in fiscal year 2021, that’s 50M more than the consensus and almost 30M more than the previous estimate of Morgan Stanley, with an average selling price of 842$, 9% more than the base case, as people tend to chose the more expensive and high tech versions of the lineup in this new 5G cycle.

The 5G super-cycle, which I believe is on the way, and will continue in the next years, as 5G become more available worldwide, could still be the biggest thing coming right away for the company with 5G smartphones [expected](https://postimg.cc/LJptP88f) to surpass 4G sales by 2024, with the average sale price of the 5G phones also coming down, helping them become more popular. This will also be helped by the recent entry to the Indian [market](https://postimg.cc/7fV6BHNS), as India will probably become the world biggest country in the next decade, this could be a huge opportunity for Apple to start and take away market-share from their competitors like Samsung and Xiaomi which have the biggest market shares right now.

They also [released](https://postimg.cc/PpWhPy31) an update iPad Pro and an all-new iPad Air in September which will also boost sales in this work-from-home environment that will keep the demand very high for this kind of products, just like the Macs. Alongside the increasing demand from the Wearables, Home & Accessories that include Air Pods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and many more products.

But the biggest reasons I believe Apple is poised for continued growth, is primarily due to its services business, as they start to offer more and more services like the Apple ONE [BUNDLE](https://postimg.cc/4777MD3s), which include up to 6 services from (Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, the new Apple Fitness+ and the iCloud service) for a pretty reasonable price in my opinion [starting](https://postimg.cc/BLkDnqzj) from 15$ up to 30$/month, this could be a great option for families and even individuals who use their services a lot.

The latest services, [Fitness+](https://postimg.cc/cKV4KrsG) just launched in the past days, and is a direct competitor to the likes of Peloton, as the service is available on the iPhone, iPad or even Apple TV. This also makes consumers buy the Apple Watch which syncs to the other devices to show you different information. The Fitness+ app just on its own is 8$/month or 80$/year which is less expensive than Peloton subscription which charges 13$ or even traditional gyms like Planet Fitness at 10$/month.

I think this will be the fastest growing sector for the company, as this aligns with the new macro trends, as the world is moving more and more to a digital approach to almost everything as consumer preferences, with more & more younger people reaching the point in life when they use these services start to align to this increasing digital approach.

We also shouldn’t forget the Apple Card & Apple Pay service among many others which also seem to gain from the move to digital & contactless payments, as this has been accelerated due to the current situation in the past year.

And one last piece of [news](https://postimg.cc/k6BKCVTr), and the most recent one, is that Apple may have fast-tracked the Titan project. The Titan project is targeting a 2024 or 2025 push to develop an electric vehicle with advanced battery technologies, that will deliver significant increases in range at much lower costs than the current technologies while also offering self-driving capabilities.

It’s reported they will not use the same technology as Tesla Full-Self-Driving feature, but will use LIDAR sensors, similar to those that we can find in the latest iPhone 12 PRO.

I think Apple can go 2 ways with this project, they can either use the huge amount of cash the company has to buy another car-maker like Ford, GM or any other car manufacturer expect Tesla and Toyota which do have a big market cap, so that they can fast-track the potential manufacturing of cars, or they can enter into a partnership with big companies like Tesla, Volkswagen or any other car marker to either produce cars or license their technology to this other car-makers which would ultimately and probably have higher margin-returns than the effective manufacturing of cars. Apple’s current overall [gross margins](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) stand at 38% vs the 15% average of the world top 10 automakers by market cap, which is significantly lower.

But this Apple Car thing is so far out, and there are so many unknowns, I will not try to predict anything related to this until there is more clarity on the subject.

And last, before moving on to some predictions, here are some of the highlights that we heard from the latest investors conference meeting, as the CEO, Tim Cook [expressed](https://postimg.cc/TyhpLzgg) optimism ahead with the launch of many new products and services, especially the Home Pod Mini and the new 5G iPhones, as these new iPhones include new LIDAR scanners that greatly improve the camera capabilities, as the iPhone as seen very positive reviews. We also saw the Senior VP and CFO, Luca Maestri give us great [outlook](https://postimg.cc/DWDmqxPD) for the company as they expect the installed devices base to continue to growth despite already being at an all-time high as they have over 585M paid subscriptions on their platforms and expect this to surpass 600M by the end of 2020.

I also researched and found what products we can see in the near future, with the first half of [2021](https://postimg.cc/jCBQsXVM) bringing new iMacs, the AirPods3 and the iPad Pro, while in the [FALL](https://postimg.cc/8jVJKngg) event we will probably get the new iPhone 13 alongside the iPhone SE PLUS and the Watch Series 7 with more products coming [later](https://postimg.cc/GHc3s01t) in 2021 or that don’t have an estimated release date like the Air Pods Pro, the Air Tags and the iPad Mini 6.

So, before even starting, you should know that I am bull on Apple but I am willing to hear other opinions so don’t be afraid to leave a comment down below.

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the [company](https://postimg.cc/JHRDpPGQ), the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.

This are my 2025 projections for Apple, let’s take a closer look at them, each on their own.

So, in term of revenues, Apple has 5 big sources of income, which saw an overall increase of 6% despite lagging sales in the iPhone. The biggest revenue is by far the iPhone right now with over $137B in revenue in the fiscal year ending in September. I expect to see the iPhone sales increasing in the next years, especially in 2021, with the new 5G iPhone creating a super-cycle for the [company](https://postimg.cc/XGfBKT7J), as most iPhone users, including myself here, as I will upgrade from my iPhone X, will switch to this new product. The iPhone sales have decreased in the last couple of years by 14% and 3% as a result of the product not having big improvements, as well as iPhone usually starting to last longer than previous models, so I expect to see a 12% increase in sales next year and a gradual decrease in the growth of sales as more people upgrade, ending with just a 5% growth in iPhone [sales](https://postimg.cc/V0wfRpr7) in 2025.

The next revenues stream is from the Mac, which has seen an increase in the past 2years, with revenues topping $28B this year after the huge demand from the work from home consumers. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/1405tm2b) this trend to continue as they plan to continue to launch better products and I can see the company having a similar growth next year before starting to decline slightly until 2025, also ending with a 5% growth.

The iPad is currently the smallest revenue stream for Apple but has also seen an increase in demand in the past 2 years with a 13% average increase in revenues. I also expect the iPad to continue to grow in the next couple of years, especially with the learn-from-home environment for kids, and even after this period ends, the transformation for learning will implicate more digital usage. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/5XKtVsT0) the iPad to see some similar growth to the Macs, especially with the latest generation also bringing a new iPad air to the market.

The 4th revenue stream and the fastest growing in the past 2 years, with an average growth of 33% are the wearables, home & accessories revenues. This have topped $30B this year, as Apple has also just launched the Apple Watch series 6 and also feature other great products like Apple TV, the Air Pods the Home Pod and the Home Pod mini alongside other third-party accessories.

I gave this [revenue](https://postimg.cc/v4C4JQ4T) stream a growth of 20% starting next year with a gradual decrease to around 8% by 2025, as I believe this will become more & more popular as they start to offer more vertical integration.

And last, but by no means least, the revenue stream that I expect to grow the most and the fastest is the revenue from the services that Apple offers. This includes revenues from Apple Care, Advertising, Cloud Services, Payment Services like Apple Card & Apple Pay and of course the digital content which includes fees from the App Store alongside subscription-based income including the new Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ alongside the already know Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+ and hopefully I don’t forget any others.

So, I [expect](https://postimg.cc/svV7mDWR) this to become the clear 2nd biggest revenue stream for Apple by 2025, as I expect this to grow more than 20% next year, mainly due to the Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ followed up by a slightly decreasing growth, ending with a 10% increase in revenues in 2025.

I think this are fairly conservative base case scenarios for the revenues, as I expect them to continue to increase the [other](https://postimg.cc/1VFFgkxJ) revenue streams and not have such a large percentage of the revenues coming from the iPhone sales as you can see in this chart.

In terms of expenses, I pretty much kept the same margins as in previous years, with a 68% expense ratio on product sales \[ [iPhone](https://postimg.cc/JDZ7jMnD) / [iPad](https://postimg.cc/Wd14CB9C) / [Mac](https://postimg.cc/q6GkZw2p) / [WHA](https://postimg.cc/211q9q8g) \] and 35% expense ratio on [SERVICES](https://postimg.cc/8sdLLrjH), as this are way more lucrative.

In the past 3 years, the products [gross margin](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) was 32.7%, so I actually imply bigger expenses for the manufacturing and sales of products, as this is mostly impacted by the company’s supplier’s ability to make up for and demand, while for the services revenue, the gross margins for the last 3 years has been 63.5% on average, but I expect this to be more in-line with the 66% margin in this past year. So, if services manage to grow to about half the revenues from the iPhone, this will effectively double the gross revenues, as every buck gained in the service revenues account for 2$ in the product sales.

So, I expect the total [revenues](https://postimg.cc/sMjByQ2n) for Apple to increase from $274B in 2020 to over $440B by 2025, increasing by approximately 10%/year, while I will keep the expense ratio pretty much in-line and have them increasing by 11%/year, this would bring the total gross income for Apple to $177B, increasing mainly due to the services revenues as I said earlier. This growth is just above the 4year [average](https://postimg.cc/Tp8g83mS), and below the 2018 levels, which we might see again with this 5G super-cycle and explosive growth in the services revenue.

I also think the company will continue to invest in both Capital Expenditure and Operating expenses.

I think the operating expenses will remain pretty much in line with the [previous](https://postimg.cc/2qBCfrnc) years, as this number has increased by 1% [annually](https://postimg.cc/Fd5JL9v8) both in R&D and SG&A. So, I will keep the exact percentages from previous years, as I expect the revenue to increase, thus I don’t see a big increase percentage wise. This would account for over $60B in operating expenses by 2025 and over $11B in Capital Expenditures by 2025, as I expect this to increase, mainly due to the possible EV developments or investments in self-driving capabilities alongside other manufacturing capabilities. You can see that the Capex [spending](https://postimg.cc/yDsRdpLy) has been decreasing in the past years with just over $8.8B in payments for business acquisitions and the other traditional Capex spending. Some people may use the cash generated by [investing](https://postimg.cc/Mn9nG6Mz) activities as Capex, but that is more unreliable. I also can see the Capex going back up, so I wanted to be safe and implied a 10% growth.

This money would account for over $73B in [expenses](https://postimg.cc/dZnY91K1) and would bring the profit for the company to almost $104B before interest and taxes.

Moving on, let’s see what interest income and expenses the [company](https://postimg.cc/cgy0x2ms) has had in the past few years. We can see a decrease in interest expense in the past few years as the company has been paying off debt, but they have also been generating less money in this department, with an overall decrease in this department of more than 50% in the past year, way less than the amount from 2018. So, for safety reasons, I used a 10% decline in both income and expenses [related](https://postimg.cc/QKgtZhZG) to interest, while increasing the other losses by 10%/year.

This would bring the company pre-tax income to just over $104B in 2025.

Let’s move on to taxes. I know the Federal income tax rate is 21% for the [company](https://postimg.cc/ykY39pq1), but the actual effective tax rate for the company was lower than 15% in the past year, mainly due to lower tax-rates on foreign earnings alongside tax-benefits and tax-settlements. The average effective tax rate has been just over 16% in the past 3 years, but with more and more of the revenues coming from outside the US, I think it’s safe to say that the company will have around a 15% effective tax rate by 2025, this obviously if nothing major changes in tax policy around the world.

So, Apple would [have](https://postimg.cc/Wqc3ytKw) $88.6B in income after tax by 2025 and with the current outstanding shares standing at just under 17B, so I don’t even account for the company probably continuing to do share buybacks, this would mean a $5.22 [future](https://postimg.cc/4YytCLwL) earnings/share. And with today’s price for Apple just around 136$, that would mean to [company](https://postimg.cc/RNf1qH44) is trading at just over 26 times forward price to earnings.

I don’t think Apple will ever trade at a discount again, with the current PE [standing](https://postimg.cc/RqwqHQ6s) at over 40, I believe this will eventually go down, probably to around 35, despite the increase in services revenue, which is highly valued by investors. I think we can see Apple trade somewhere near 35 [times](https://postimg.cc/5H98PKv2) P/E in 2025, especially if something big happens with the EV project, this could be even higher, just look at Tesla which trades at [insane](https://postimg.cc/sBZhxMk5) P/E. Of course, we also have to take into consideration the dividends that will be received from owning the stock, as Apple has started to pay dividends almost a decade ago and has 9 years of dividend growth, with a 10% annual rate of [growth](https://postimg.cc/CnbZMbD2) in the past 5 years. [Here](https://postimg.cc/7CLT1G8C) is the dividend growth history for the company, as I also went conservative on this [estimate](https://postimg.cc/Tp7LcjGr) and implied a 7% growth for the next 2 years, 6% for 2023 and 2024 and just 5% in 2025.

So [here](https://postimg.cc/R3PK21QQ) are my 3 price targets for the company, [including](https://postimg.cc/JHR8JXvv) dividends but not reinvested. My bear case scenario is that Apple will trade at almost 165$ which implies a [return](https://postimg.cc/jCYzWhd2) of over 21% by 2025, while my base case scenario would see Apple trading at 195$ with a return of capital of 43%. I will also make the bull case for Apple trading at 225$ by 2025 with dividends included, which would imply just over 65% in gains by then.

I think this is possible as Apple has also [continued](https://postimg.cc/fJj36jMt) to buy back shares of the company on a constant basis, as they continue to an impressive campaign with over $72B worth of common stock repurchased in 2020. They continue to buy back shares at a very fast pace, having repurchased over 1.3B shares in 2019 and 2018, while also issuing less stock every year.

So here is the full [spreadsheet](https://postimg.cc/Z995KrzL) that I have projected for Apple by 2025 and the breakdown of everything i estimated \[ [1](https://postimg.cc/jCT7qdZJ) / [2](https://postimg.cc/DmcbSkMp) \] , if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just [look](https://postimg.cc/V50nHCSn) at the growth Apple has had in the last 5years. The company has increased in value by more 400% in just the past 5years and is over 100.000% up since it started trading. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against Apple?

The company also has pristine [financials](https://postimg.cc/LYcYMxqf), with more than $65B in total assets compared to total liabilities, and more than $38B in cash and cash equivalents.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Apple?

Let’s look at this [CHART](https://postimg.cc/7592T1c8), so starting with the stock split, Apple saw a correction within the September stock market pullback, in a buy the news & sell the event, after a huge runup post-announcement of the stock split. The stock entered a consolidation period, and didn’t have any big catalysts, especially with new iPhone lineup not being included in the Q4 results due to the late launch. The stock found some levels of resistance near the $120 levels that it struggled to get past but acted also as support after breaking them just before the recent news of the possible EV developments or self-driving-features to be licensed to other car manufacturers. After that news the stock spiked and has now reached the previous highs made before the stock split and is facing some resistance, if the stock pushes over $140 I think we can officially say that it broke the resistance at those levels and is not just a fake-out. But I think it’s likely that the stock will consolidate between 122 and 135$ in the next weeks until the next iPhone sales and quarterly results are released, as the stock has entered overbought territory again with an RSI over 70, the first time since the stock split.

So, what would I do? Well, I own Apple stock, and I really believe this company will remain the biggest or one of the biggest in the future, so I would really add on any weakness that the stock shows before the next quarter earnings are released, as typically Q1 [earnings](https://postimg.cc/V5t0FPTF) are the best for the company due to increased holiday sales combined with the launch of new products. I think any entry below 130$ would be really nice to start and build a position or increase it if you already own the stock. As I believe Apple is one of the most stable stocks out there with large institutional [holders](https://postimg.cc/3kqG3XcK) like Vanguard, BlackRock and Berkshire owning over 900M shares each.

Unlike a traditional Chipotle location, it will not include a dining room or a line for ordering. Customers have to order in advance on Chipotle's app, website or third-party delivery platforms.

The new restaurant design is meant for urban areas, where real estate is more expensive and a full-size restaurant isn't possible, but the first location will open in Highland Falls, New York, just outside of the gates of West Point.

The design will also be able to accommodate large catering orders, which will have their own entry and lobby for pick-up.

The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated customers' shift to ordering online, pushing Chipotle to try to optimize the experience as much as possible. In the third quarter, the company reported that digital sales more than tripled. CEO Brian Niccol said total digital orders could exceed $2.5 billion this year, more than double last year's total.

The crisis and its shock to the restaurant industry has also pushed other companies to rethink their designs. Burger King and Shake Shack are among the restaurants that plan to add drive-thru lanes reserved for delivery drivers or online orders. Starbucks is now planning to build more mobile pickup cafes this year and in 2021 than it previously thought. 

Shares of Chipotle, which has a market value of $34.8 billion, have risen 67% this year. The stock rose 4% in morning trading.

It's almost like investors / traders don't realise that selling a portion of your holdings to lock in profit is perfectly viable and actually an under rated strategy. 

Nobody wants to sell their position only to see it rip the next few days or weeks and likewise nobody wants to hold their position only to see it dump.

So why not sell half? When you're unsure whether it's a good time to exit a position, just sell half, this way you keep some skin in the game if it does rip and if it tanks then at least you bagged profit to the value of 50% of your position.

&nbsp;

I assure you from an emotional point of view it feels much better being ""half"" right 100% of the time than being completely right 50% of the time. Set yourself targets to gradually exit out of your position. 

&nbsp;

For example you have 100 shares and the price reaches your initial target of $100.

$100 - sell 50 shares.

$125 - sell 25 shares.

$150 - sell 12 shares.

1400,Warren Buffett is MORE LIKELY to purchase an individual airline than sell all his airline positions.,1219,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fvgvmi/warren_buffett_is_more_likely_to_purchase_an/,223,"Update: Looks like Buffet went with option 3, selling all his shares (though he did disclose his exiting of the positions). He’s clearly of the belief that our world post-COVID will not be friendly to airlines and is cutting his losses here.

...

Here's some insight into Warren Buffett's selloff of Delta Airlines (DAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV). The backing away from airline stocks marks something of a reversal for Warren Buffett. The investor bought more Delta stock several weeks ago. Buffett told Yahoo Finance less than a month ago that ""I won't be selling airline stocks."" Why did Buffett sell so many shares of DAL and LUV yesterday? Thoughts below:

1. Warren Buffett reduced his ownership of DAL and LUV to under 10%, so he does not need to report every trade he makes. Prior to this sale, Buffett owned over 10% of DAL and LUV. Because of his significant ownership in the companies, he needs to report every move he makes to the SEC. With his ownership reduced to <10%, Buffett can buy and sell DAL and LUV without needing to report it until the end of the quarter. Now his airline stakes are all <10%. 

2. Buffett is NOT selling DAL for cash to invest elsewhere. Berkshire Hathaway is currently sitting on $128B in cash. Buffett has plenty of ammunition to buy any stock he likes. Therefore, his move to sell DAL and LUV is NOT to free up money to purchase other stocks. 

3. Buffett may be about to make a dramatic move as airlines have ~3 months without government aid until it runs out of cash. We will use DAL as a representation of the airline industry. Accounting for cash and cash equivalents and credit withdrawal only, DAL only has 3 months of cash left given its CEO reported the company is burning through $60M per day. Of course, this is not accounting for government support, other current assets, and cost cutting (e.g., furloughing employees). With these measures, DAL may have a few months above water. Given the situation that DAL is in, Buffett is likely about to make a dramatic move - either sell off his remaining airline positions or purchase 100% shares of an airline company.

Here are three things Buffett may be doing in order of likelihood:

1. High Likelihood: Buffett is simply trimming his positions so they are under 10% stake. Buffett has mentioned several times that he likes to own less than 10% stake for reporting reasons, specifically in regards to airline stocks. He may have just trimmed his stake to <10% and plan on holding there.

2. Moderate Likelihood: Buffett is reducing stakes in DAL and LUV as it plans to acquire and competitor airline. Prior to Buffett's acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railway, he scaled down his position in Union Pacific (UNP) and Norfolk Southern (NSC) railways about a year before his purchase of BNSF. If Buffett is thinking about purchasing an airline, which he has contemplated in the past, he may be targeting American Airlines, which he currently owns the largest stake in (10%). Keep in mind that before he extended a tender offer to BNSF, he owned 17% of the company. Finally, Buffett already owns NetJets, the world's largest private jet company.

3. Low Likelihood: Buffett reduced his shares to <10% so he does not need to report his complete exit from airlines. There is speculation that Buffett is reducing his stake to under 10% so he can exit airlines completely without needing to report his trades. We believe this is unlikely because Buffett's mantra is ""be greedy when others are fearful"". Airlines are not going anywhere as the U.S. is one of the most globalized nations. The only reason why Buffett may be selling is if he fears the government stake in airlines will be at a significantly reduced price. With this said, he may as well just buy the airline at that point to not sell at a complete loss.",2020-04-06 03:49:49

To determine ""top 3 market cap"" I used the Q1 values in [Financial Times' Global 500 list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization). Since the FT Global 500 list started in 1996, that is where I begin.

In my **Big 3 Portfolio**, I purchase $1000 worth of each that year's top 3 market capitalization companies at their Jan 1st open price.

In my **SPY Portfolio**, I purchase $3000 a year of SPY (S&P 500 tracking index, aka ""the market"") at it's Jan 1st open price.

Thus the total cash basis of 25 annual batches of $3000 is $75,000 for each portfolio.

I found that the Big 3 Portfolio beat the SPY portfolio by about **$34,281.34, 20.75% over the value of the final SPY Portfolio value.**

*IMPORTANT NOTES:*

* *After pulling all the data, I realized the faulty assumption of this study is that the FT500 market cap ranking is posted on January 1st to know which 3 companies to purchase for that year. I have no idea what day it was posted, and if the years before the FT500 went to quarterly rankings were later in the year it might be showing more in hindsight instead of foresight. In hindsight, I probably should have purchased the previous year's top picks those early years and the previous Q4 picks after the survey went quarterly. May do a version 2 along those lines at some point.*
* *I do not reinvest -- or even count -- dividends. I may include that on a version 2.0. Factoring in dividends (especially if you are reinvesting at market price on the day of issuance) and their potential tax implications for each of the 75 lots would make the analysis significantly more complex.*
* *I used fractional shares (i.e. however many shares you could have purchased with exactly $1000). That might not have been possible when this started but is possible now.*
* *This assumes no additional buying or selling beyond the initial annual purchase with new capital. There is NO REALIGNMENT (which would involve cap gains, etc.). This is pure dollar cost averaging. Another analysis worth doing might consider cashing out companies that drop out of the top 3 on the last day of the year and buying the new ones taking their place with the profits you have built up so far in a non-taxable account like a Roth. This would keep you from holding companies like GE and Exxon as they decline might lead to bigger returns, I'd guess.*

Here are my findings, broken down into combined annual lots of $3000 for each portfolio.

The annual Big 3 lot beat the annual SPY lot long-term 19 out of 25 years. This is very heavily indebted to Microsoft offsetting many years of Exxon and GE being top 3 companies which are now in major decline. On the individual stock side, it wasn't nearly as lopsided: 38 of 75 batches beat $1000 worth of SPY purchased on the same day, 37 did not. As we slip into the past decade, the ratio of underperformers number drops drastically, with 25 batches outperforming the market and 8 underperforming it.

Microsoft (21 years), Apple (11 years) Amazon (2 years) and Google (3 years) beat the matching SPY lot every single year it made the list.

Exxon Mobil (19 years), GE (13 years), Cisco (1 year), Chevron (1 year), Wal-mart (1 year) and Coca-Cola (1 year) to date lost to the equivalent SPY lot every single year they made the list.

Berkshire split, with one year beating the market and one year losing to it.

The analyst raised his price target for the automaker's shares to $1,900 from $1,800 on Monday while maintaining a ""neutral"" rating on the stock. The new 12-month target implies a 15% jump from Friday's close and would place shares at record highs.",2020-08-18 00:32:37

Ives sees Tesla surging 56% from current levels to $1,000 a share in his bull case scenario.

# **The stimulus boost has passed and now the stock market is focused solely on virus developments  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/03/the-stimulus-boost-has-passed-and-now-the-stock-market-is-focused-solely-on-virus-developments.html)**
*****
> The stock market enters a four-day week that is the lull before earnings season, but it’s the headlines on developments around the spread of the coronavirus that may result in the most volatility.
*****
> Strategists say investors are now most focused on how the virus is progressing, what medical developments might help, and how long it could take to end the shutdown of most of the U.S. 
*****
> “I think it’s a wait and see with a drift to the downside. I think if you look back to that three-, four-day rally we had in March, capping off the end of the month, I think a lot of that was reaction to the Fed, a lot of it was reaction to the stimulus out of Washington,” said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equities strategist at RBC. “There were good vibes coming off of that, but that was yesterday’s news. I think the Fed has done a good job. They have peoples’ confidence...One thing we now need is a decline in the number of virus cases in the U.S.”
*****
> Oil could be a factor in the week ahead as OPEC and Russia hold an emergency meeting Monday to discuss production cuts. Oil rallied 12% in the past week with West Texas Intermediate futures at $28.34 per barrel, its best week ever.  President Donald Trump sparked the rally when he said he spoke to Saudi Arabia and Russia and they wanted a deal to cut production. 
*****
> In the past week, stocks were lower for the third week in four, as the market absorbed the latest shocking reports of layoffs, and investors worried about the duration of the virus related shutdowns. The S&P 500 closed down 2% for the week, at 2,488.
*****
> # Jobs picture
> On Sunday, Trump extended the guidelines on social distancing to April 30, as the number of cases grew.
*****
> Thursday’s report of 6.6 million new unemployment claims for the week ended March 28 brought the two week total of workers filing claims to 10 million. The biggest data report in the week ahead could again be that jobless claims number on Thursday.  
*****
> “We look for 7 million new claims to be reported for the week ended April 4, though obviously the range of uncertainty around this forecast is wide, and a substantial decline is also possible,” noted J.P. Morgan economist Jesse Edgerton.
*****
> Consumer sentiment is reported Thursday, and consumer price index inflation is reported Friday, when the stock market is closed for the Good Friday holiday.
*****
> “I’m not a big believer that investors gain a lot of information from single points of data and even less right now,” said Mike Swell, co-head of global portfolio management at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “We need the world to open back up. We need the global economies to open back up to have any sense of the lasting impact of this on jobs. The concerns in corporate boardrooms is how conservative they’re going to be when it comes to cap ex and hiring.”
*****
> The Fed releases minutes of its last meeting Wednesday.
*****
> “The schedule doesn’t matter anymore. What matters now is how the pandemic is playing out, the extent of the downturn of the economy, and then how capital markets are functioning,” Swell said. “All of those things together are going to drive what the Fed’s going to do, and they’ll act when they need to take action.”
*****
> The Fed has flooded the markets with liquidity and is ballooning its balance sheet with Treasury and mortgage purchases. Swell said the Fed’s programs are helping the markets they’ve taken aim at including corporate debt, mortgages and commercial paper.
*****
> # Earnings ahead
> First quarter earnings season is scheduled to start in the week after next, and there could be more companies withdrawing guidance between now and then.
*****
> “We’re all facing the realization [the virus shutdown] that it’s going to take longer, it’s going to go deeper and that alone is taking the wind out of the sales,” said Calvasina. “Then the companies are going to report , and they’re not going to tell us anything...companies are just withdrawing guidance. It’s not even like there’s a new lower bar. Are we going to come out of this with a bar or are we going to come out of this with no direction?”
*****
> According to Refinitiv, earnings are expected to decline about 5.5% for the first quarter, which saw the biggest impact from the virus in the final weeks of March. 
*****
> Calvasina said she expects the market to retest the lows of March 23, in part because it does not seem investors have gotten negative enough. She said they do not appear to be factoring in the latest gloomy projections from economists of a more than 30% decline in second quarter GDP. She said the market could still have a ways to go before bottoming, and notes the financial crisis drop was 49%. A drop of that magnitude would take the S&P to 1,727.
*****
> Her own survey of clients shows that many investors still have a bullish view on the market with a six to 12-month horizon. “We’re seeing investors taking a constructive view. They like what the Fed has done.There seems to be a view about the economy that the damage is really going to be concentrated in the second quarter, and it’s going to be contained in terms of depth and contained in terms of duration,” she said.

# A Technical Look at Market Internals

> Following last week’s more than 10% gain, the S&P 500 Index is tracking toward another weekly loss, its fifth of the last seven. This has many investors wondering if a retest of the lows may be in the cards for US equities. As we explored in our How Markets Bottom post, two of the bear markets we believe show the most similarities to our current one did retest or undercut the lows after the worst of the selling.

> “Whether or not we get a retest is an open question,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But we believe we’ve seen the worst of the selling, and we will be watching to confirm that fewer individual stocks are making new lows on a further pullback in the indexes.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blog-picture-4.3.20.png?ssl=1))**

> As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, although the S&P 500 made its low on March 23, more stocks actually bottomed a week earlier on March 16, when more than two-thirds of the individual stocks in the index hit a one-year low. Regardless of the direction of the S&P 500 over the coming days, we want to see this trend of fewer stocks making new lows continue.

# Road to Recovery Playbook Factor #1: COVID-19 Case Update

> Factor #1 in our Road to Recovery Playbook is finding confidence in the peak of COVID-19 cases in the United States. At LPL Research we are monitoring this factor daily, and we wanted to provide an update into what we are seeing. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, while the number of new cases in the United States has continued to climb, the number of new cases seen outside of the US has begun to drop in recent days. In fact, Italy, the worst-hit country in terms of total deaths from the virus, reported on Tuesday that new cases hit a two-week low.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/picture-blog-cases-pandemic.png?ssl=1))**

> This data is important because thus far the number of COVID-19 cases has conformed to Farr’s Law of Epidemics, exhibiting a somewhat predictable bell curve normal-like distribution. Formulated in the 1800s by British epidemiologist Dr. William Farr, these laws predict that epidemics normally follow a pattern of sharp increase, a peak, and then a decline back to a baseline.

> The distributions of both new COVID-19 cases and related fatalities in China and South Korea have exhibited this behavior and appear to have ridden out the initial outbreak cycle. The City of Wuhan, China, which was the initial epicenter for the virus, reported on March 19 that it had zero new cases—showing us that the curve can be flattened and there is light at the end of this dark tunnel.

> “The market’s bounce last week may have been in anticipation of some of these more positive data points regarding the virus,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While US cases continue to climb, the more countries that reach their peak, the more clarity we gain into what that timing may look like for the United States. Investors have historically been rewarded for investing during these crisis events, and we believe the time for suitable investors to consider adding some risk to their portfolios may be approaching.”

# Can April’s Top-Month Record Extend Market Rally?

> April marks the end of the “Best Six Months” for DJIA and the S&P 500. The window for the seasonal MACD sell signal opens on April 1st. The unprecedented speed of the current market selloff and current bear market would appear to have made this year’s signal insignificant. This could be the case, but it is far too early to say if the worst of the bear market is over. Double-digit DJIA losses during the “Best Six Months” have only occurred three times (ending in April in 1970, 1974 and 2009) since 1950. In 1970 & 2009 the “Worst Six Months” were positive while in 1974 DJIA slide another 20.5%.

> April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, “Tax” month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up fourteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.3% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is second best for S&P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).

> The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April. This year, guidance will likely be the greatest focus, as first and second quarter earnings are likely to be disappointing as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

> Historically bullish election-year influences (the second-best year of the four-year presidential election cycle) have the exact opposite effect on April. Average gains since 1952 are approximately half of the average gain of all years since 1950 for DJIA and S&P 500. Largely due to a 15.6% loss in 2000, NASDAQ’s typical strength in all Aprils since 1971 is transformed into an average loss in election years.

> This data is important because thus far the number of COVID-19 cases has conformed to Farr’s Law of Epidemics, exhibiting a somewhat predictable bell curve normal-like distribution. Formulated in the 1800s by British epidemiologist Dr. William Farr, these laws predict that epidemics normally follow a pattern of sharp increase, a peak, and then a decline back to a baseline.

> The distributions of both new COVID-19 cases and related fatalities in China and South Korea have exhibited this behavior and appear to have ridden out the initial outbreak cycle. The City of Wuhan, China, which was the initial epicenter for the virus, reported on March 19 that it had zero new cases—showing us that the curve can be flattened and there is light at the end of this dark tunnel.

> “The market’s bounce last week may have been in anticipation of some of these more positive data points regarding the virus,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While US cases continue to climb, the more countries that reach their peak, the more clarity we gain into what that timing may look like for the United States. Investors have historically been rewarded for investing during these crisis events, and we believe the time for suitable investors to consider adding some risk to their portfolios may be approaching.”

# Down Best Six Months Not Encouraging

> The depth of this waterfall decline may be too deep for the market to rebound quickly. This bear market also put this year’s Best Six Months (November-April) at risk of being negative. The record of down Best Six Months is not encouraging and it reminds us of a salient quote from the Almanac from an old market sage, “If the market does not rally, as it should during bullish seasonal periods, it is a sign that other forces are stronger and that when the seasonal period ends those forces will really have their say.”— Edson Gould (Stock market analyst, Findings & Forecasts, 1902-1987)

> The table below of Down Best Six Month for DJIA since 1950 also suggests caution and patience is in order. Subsequent Worst Six Months (May-October) have averaged losses with only two decent years 1982 and 2009. The market bottom in August 1982 marked the end of the 1966-1982 secular bear market and came of the early 1980s double dip recession. Following the first back-to-back down Best Six Months since 1973-1974, the market hit a secular bear market low in March 2009. Market action in the rest of these years was rather grim.

# Sector Relative Strength

> Over the past year, the Technology sector has been the most notable sector in terms of outperformance relative to the S&P 500. As shown in the charts from our Sector Snapshot below, the relative strength chart for Technology has been in a steady uptrend for the past twelve months without much interruption even while the decade long bull market was coming to an end. In fact, last week it was the first sector to exit oversold territory after every sector was oversold for 13 days. The other sectors have not been as lucky. During the recent sell off, the relative performance of most sectors, especially cyclicals like Energy, Financials, and Industrials, fell sharply (indicating even worse declines than the S&P 500). Consumer Staples and Health Care, on the other hand, have seen much stronger performance than the rest of the market.

# Consumers Turn Bearish on Equities

> Tuesday's Consumer Confidence report managed to exceed expectations, but as we noted at the time, the survey for the March reports cuts off on the 18th, so as economic conditions turned south, sentiment levels also likely declined. One area of the report where sentiment already has seen a notable decline is in consumer sentiment towards stock prices. As shown in the top chart below, the percentage of consumers expecting stock prices to decline nearly doubled from 21.7% up to 39.2% while the percentage of consumers looking for higher prices dropped from 43.1% down to 32.3%. In the case of negative sentiment, the percentage of bearish consumers hasn't been this high since late 2012.

> Given the major shift in sentiment, the spread between bullish and bearish consumers has seen a major reversal falling from firmly positive (21.4) to firmly negative (-6.9). By this measure, the spread between bullish and bearish investors hasn't been this negative since February 2016.

# The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly Commodities in Q1

> Very few assets have been winners recently, especially in the commodities space. As shown in the table below, no major energy or metal commodities (front-month futures) rose in March and gold was the only one to rise in the first quarter. The degree of those declines varied greatly. While gasoline and WTI futures (crude oil) were more than cut in half, gold and iron ore fell less than one percent in March. Considering iron ore's cyclical nature, that small decline is somewhat surprising but as for Q1, iron ore's performance was much weaker with a decline of over 10.5%. Granted, that is still a far better performance than copper which was down by more than twice that. Given the size of these declines, every one of the commodities highlighted below sits well off of its 52-week high. Gasoline and crude oil are the worst of these at 74.14% and 69.63%, respectively. As for where they finished the quarter relative to their 52-week lows, things are mixed. Gasoline, gold, and silver are off those lows by double-digit percentages while the rest are less than 10% away.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Table-2.png))**

> As with many charts across assets, the technical picture of these commodities looks ugly. Almost every one has broken below significant support levels and safe-haven gold is the only one currently in anything other than a downtrend. Although it finished the month just off of the lows, crude oil fell all the way to its lowest levels since 2002 after crashing through support in February. The same can be said for gasoline. Natural gas remains a pain trade with the downtrend of the past several months still firmly in place.

> Given its safe-haven status, gold has again been an outperformer approaching some of its highest levels of the past decade during the risk asset rout of the past couple of months. But it has recently been a more volatile trade. The yellow metal has yet to break above resistance around 1,700/oz and has even fallen to support around the 50-DMA. Despite also having the precious metal status, silver has been a serial underperformer to gold. Silver never shared gold's rally over the past couple of months as it fell to its lowest levels since 2009.

> As for industrial metals, copper has been hovering around its lowest levels since the final quarter of 2016 after falling through the past year's support around $2.50. On the bright side, the technicals of iron ore have been slightly more constructive as it has still held up at support around $75.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",2020-04-05 02:20:25
1421,"Trying something new: A small portfolio allocation to the ""Worst"" stocks of 2020",1160,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jav13o/trying_something_new_a_small_portfolio_allocation/,261,"I was doing some research on what analysts of years past said were the worst stock picks of previous years. I decided to do some performance analysis of these picks.

In 2012, a financial [article](https://moneymorning.com/2012/12/31/the-best-and-worst-stocks-of-2012/) wrote that these were the 5 ""Best"" stock picks of the year:

**PulteGroup Inc (PHM)** \- It's had some volatility but overall has grown by about 180% in 8 years

**Sprint (S)** \- Pulling data is hard but it appears that Sprint was pretty volatile but overall had a nice run, then a decline, until it was bought at 280% above its 2012 price

**Whirlpool Corp (WHR)** \- It had some volatile growth but is currently sitting at 99% growth from its 2012 price

**Expedia (EXPE)** \- It had a nice period of a lot of growth but COVID hit it hard. It's now sitting at 59% up from its 2012 price

**Bank of America (BAC)** \- It grew quite a bit for a while but it hasn't fully recovered from COVID yet. It's currently up 135% from its 2012 price

**If you had invested $1k in the 5 ""Best"" stocks of 2012  at an even distribution (and HELD), you would now be sitting on about $2500, or over 150% growth.**

Now let's see what the ""Worst"" stocks of 2012 were:

**Radioshack (RSH)** \- Sold in 2015 having lost effectively 100% of 2012 value

**SUPERVALU Inc (SVU)** \- Immediately experienced a 3 year 500% run-up, fell, then was sold in 2018 up 62% from 2012 value

**Apollo Group (APOL)** \- Sold in 2015 at 50% less than its 2012 value

**Best Buy Inc (BBY)** \- Almost immediately after the author hit send, this stock had an eight year run-up. It is now up 900% the value it was in 2012

**Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)** \- It took a few years but eventually had a run-up over 3400%. AMD, everyone. This was among the ""worst stocks of 2012.

**If you had invested $1k in the 5 ""Worst"" stocks of 2012  at an even distribution (and HELD), you would now be sitting on over $9000, or over 800% growth.**

If you had taken all that many and just bought VOO in 2012, you'd be sitting at about **145% growth.**

Of course, AMD is the real diamond here. Without it, this outcome would look different.

**But even if we remove AMD, the other 4 ""worst"" stocks would have seen 140% growth.**

**What does this all mean?**

I think it means you shouldn't *necessarily* overlook ""bad"" stocks. Of course, do your due diligence. And definitely don't invest all your eggs there.

The outlook looks worse and worse for cruise line operators this 2020.  

BUT if COVID-19 recedes quickly, travel will likely resume quickly. Rapidly declining fuel prices could also help benefit the cost structure to a greater degree, due to Carnival’s floating energy prices. 

Having said that I’m waiting for an entry price of $12, and I hope we scrape that today so I can hold some Carnival for the coming months. It’s more risk than I would usually take on, but I see potential upside.

Adding TikTok would make Microsoft a major player in the digital ad business, which currently has 70% of market share going to Google, Facebook, and Amazon, according to eMarketer.

Among 18 to 24 year-olds, only 17% use Microsoft-owned LinkedIn. For TikTok, that number is more than double at 42%. Only Instagram (82%), Twitter (46%), and Facebook (46%) have a greater reach with young adults.

Around 90% of Microsoft’s $1.6 trillion current valuation can be attributed to its enterprise cloud strategy, including Azure and Office 365, according to Wedbush. Acquiring TikTok would help Microsoft diversify its business and find new areas for growth.

The deal is the second-largest acquisition of a North American restaurant chain in at least a decade, behind the $13.3 billion deal for Tim Hortons by Restaurant Brands International Inc. in 2014, according to investment data provider Dealogic. Inspire, the owner of Arby’s and other chains that is backed by private-equity firm Roark Capital, said the deal will make it the second-largest U.S. restaurant chain by domestic sales after McDonald’s Corp. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year, the companies said on Friday.

Inspire said its all-cash deal to take the owner of Dunkin’ coffee shops and Baskin-Robbins ice cream stores private would value it at $106.50 a share, a 20% premium to its closing price on Oct. 23, before the New York Times reported last weekend that the two companies were discussing a possible deal.

The price of $106.50 a share would give Dunkin’ a market valuation of $8.8 billion. The chain’s stock closed on Friday at $100, up 32% this year.

1431,Nio stock gets upgrade at Goldman Sachs,1129,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k4rvp7/nio_stock_gets_upgrade_at_goldman_sachs/,176,"‘In hindsight, we underestimated’ Nio, Goldman Sachs says

Goldman Sachs analysts flipped their stance on Nio Inc., saying that in hindsight they underestimated the benefits that the Chinese electric-vehicle maker would get from breakthroughs such as its battery-swap idea.

The analysts, led by Fei Fang, upgraded Nio’s NIO stock to the equivalent of hold, from sell, saying in a note Tuesday that when they tacked on their sell rating in July they did so on valuation. They believed that “the share price at the time reflected over-optimism given no substantial changes to volume/profit expectations.”

What’s changed? Mostly, Nio unveiled its battery-as-a-service program, expanding its market. Most households in China lack conditions to install private chargers, especially outside of main cities, Goldman said.

The analysts also upped their 12-month target price on Nio’s American depositary receipts to $59.00 from $7.70.

Nio launched its battery-as-a-service program in August; service users purchase a Nio car without the battery, “making it more price competitive against existing powertrains, while also providing the flexibility to change battery capacity depending on their needs,” the Goldman analysts said.

Existing public charging stalls are often busy, but within “10 minutes, Nio car owners can swap their depleted battery with a fully charged one, which is much more time efficient than the fast charger stall that requires around 2.5 hours.”

“In addition, (battery-as-a-service) also represents a systematic solution to the long-existing challenges for EV penetration, including battery degradation, battery upgradability, and lower resale value,” they said.

Nio’s ADRs have gained nearly 1,100% this year, compared with gains around 13% for the S&P 500 index. SPX The average rating on Nio of the 13 analysts polled by FactSet is the equivalent of buy, and the average price target on the ADRs is $42.18, representing an 11% downside from Tuesday’s prices.

The iPhone made a flashy and highly-anticipated entrance to the Indian market, where Apple sold the devices through Indian carriers Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India. But in the 12 years since, Apple’s captured just 2% of India’s smartphone market, which now totals a half billion users. By contrast, it owns 46% of the market in the U.S. and 8.5% in China.

In 2019, the average smartphone sold in India cost roughly $160, whereas iPhones range from $400 to over $1,000. The disparity helps explain why Apple holds a 49% share of the premium smartphone market in India but only 2% of the overall market.

One plan would toughen listing standards on U.S. stock exchanges for what the administration calls non-cooperating jurisdictions (NCJs). But this really targets China as other countries have agreements with the PCAOB.

For Chinese companies—such as tech giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu, Inc.—that want to continue with their listing or want to initiate listing on a U.S. exchange, the PCAOB must have access to audit work papers of the principal audit firm. Companies that cannot grant access because of government restrictions can satisfy this standard by providing a co-audit from an accounting firm “with comparable resources and experience” that the PCAOB determined can conduct proper exams.

The new listing standard gives a transition period until January 1, 2022, for already listed companies. The new standards will be immediately applied to new listings after rulemakings become effective.

Details of the recommendations are in a July 24, 2020, report drafted by the President’s Working Group (PWG) on Financial Markets. PWG is chaired by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, and he made the report public on August 6. This responds to a June 4 memorandum by President Trump directing the PWG to come up with plans to address the problem.

*****
> Stocks next week will come off one of their best months ever into a busy week of economic data and the ongoing tensions between the spreading virus and positive news on vaccines and treatments.
*****
> Another highlight of the week is expected to be Tuesday’s testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the Senate Banking Committee. They will be discussing the emergency measures taken to help the economy after the outbreak of the pandemic.
*****
> The Dow was up nearly 13% for November so far, and if it holds its gains into Monday’s close, it will chalk up its best month since January, 1987. The S&P 500 closed at a record 3,638 and was up 11.3% for the month. The gain is its best performance since April’s 12.7%, which was the third best month for the S&P 500 since its origin in 1957.
*****
> November was a big month also for market rotation, with investors favoring stocks that would benefit from a rebounding economy and showing less love for long-held favorites among big tech and internet names. Financials were up more than 17% in the past month, and industrials rose nearly 15%, as investors bet vaccines would help the economy return to normal next year.
*****
> Tech notched a single digit gain for the month so far and lagged the broader market. But some strategists expect big tech and internet names, stay-at-home stocks, to fare better in December.
*****
> “The death of big tech has been announced over and over again, and we see that the market doesn’t abandon them, but in fact migrates to big tech whenever there are concerns,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The post-pandemic question is whether big tech can co-exist with the small and mid-cap.” Small caps were one of the biggest winners in November, with the Russell 2000, up 20.6%.
*****
> “We did not see major selling in Nasdaq,” as investors put funds in cyclicals and value, she said. Nasdaq was up 11.9% for the month so far, slightly better than the S&P 500.
*****
> Experts have warned that there could an even bigger surge in virus cases, following the Thanksgiving holiday which could start to show up in the coming week. There have been more than 12.6 million cases in the U.S.
*****
> # Jobs report
> There are some important economic reports in the week ahead, the most important being Friday’s November employment report. There is is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday.
*****
> “My thought here is the data is going to matter because if you listen to the Fed, and if you read through the Fed’s minutes, they’re in transition here. They’re becoming more concerned about the rise in Covid cases, certainly about the lack of fiscal support,” said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.
*****
> Strategists say another key report will be weekly jobless claims, which showed an increase in each of the last two weeks. “The employment data clearly has been weakening,” said Faranello. If it continues, it will keep a lid on Treasury yields, which move opposite prices.
*****
> Jefferies economist Tom Simons expects the elimination of Census Bureau workers to detract from the job gains in November, and he forecasts the economy added just 340,000 jobs.
*****
> “It is hard to envision a particularly strong report coming out on Friday,” noted Simons.
*****
> Bank of America economists forecast just 150,000 payrolls were added for November, compared to 638,000 in October. The private sector is expected to add 300,000, but expected government layoffs impacted total payrolls in their forecast.
*****
> Faranello said he expects the bond market to be much more active than normal this December because of the pending change in the White House, as well as the runoff election in Georgia Jan. 5 that will decide whether Republicans keep their Senate majority. The market has also been concerned about the lack of stimulus from Washington.
*****
> “The theme in the market right now is definitely hope and optimism versus the on the ground dynamic with Covid,” said Faranello. “The real question is can the vaccine rally hold up if we see the virus rise and we continue to see shutdowns. How does the market perform in light of that?”
*****
> Krosby said she expects the market to watch for vaccine news. “The question I think is now whether or not we see the emergency authorization given to Pfizer and followed by Moderna,” she said. “I think that is a catalyst to the market because that is when you will start to see the vaccine distributed.” The Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee has a meeting set for Dec. 10 to discuss emergency authorization for the Pfizer
*****
> Analysts expect investors to continue to gravitate to value and cyclicals, since they could have the biggest gains compared to already high priced big tech. But tech is still attractive.
*****
> “We still see the Nasdaq leading,” said Krosby. “Whereas we enjoyed the vaccine related boom in the market, the fact is that investors and and traders are looking for big tech names to give them that growth in earnings and revenues.”

> # December Almanac: Small Caps Have Shined

> December is now the number three S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It’s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not highly likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.

> In the last seventeen election years, December’s ranking changed modestly to #2 DJIA, #5 NASDAQ, but S&P 500 remains #3. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have had a field day in election-year Decembers. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just once in ten election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 3.0%. The Russell 2000’s single loss was in 1980 when the Prime Rate was 21.5%.

> # Sector Weights Rising and Falling

> For most of the past year, one significant trend on a sector by sector basis has been the outperformance of sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. The relative strength lines of these sectors have consistently shown outperformance versus the rest of the S&P 500 as a whole, but since August, other sectors have begun to take the wheel. As we noted in today's Sector Snapshot, just about every sector has had a banner month in November with some of the biggest month to date rallies of the past 30 years, but some sectors have seen much larger returns than others. One of the best examples of this has been Energy which has risen over 35% in November. Similarly, Financials has risen an astounding 19.5% this month compared to more modest but still significant rallies of around 10% from Tech and Consumer Discretionary. Given those large degrees of outperformance, the relative strength lines of Energy and Financials have taken a sharp turn higher in recent weeks. Similarly, they have seen a turnaround in their weightings in the S&P 500 as shown in the charts below.

> Over the past three months, the Financial sector has gained a full percentage point weighting while the Technology sector has lost 1.36 percentage points with a decline in weighting in three straight months. For Financials, that is the largest gain in weighting in a three month span since January 2017. For Tech, outside of the reshuffling in 2018 that saw a large share of its weight change into Communication Services, the last time the sector lost this much or more in weighting in three months was November of 2008. Prior to this recent string of losing weight over the past three months, Tech had seen weight gain in every month from October of last year through August. Even though the weight loss has been significant, it has only put a dent in the increased share of the entirety of the past year as the sector's weight is only back down to where it was in May.

> Similarly, looking at the other sectors, while Financials have added a full percentage point in share over the past few months, that follows nine months of declines running from last December through August. That brings the sector's weighting back above 10% in the S&P 500, but that is only at the highest level since March. Similarly, Materials and Industrials have also seen their weights rise for three and four months in a row, respectively. As for Energy, the 0.44 percentage point gain in November is set to snap six straight months of declines; the longest such streak since at least 1990. As with Financials, that turn around this month has only put a dent in the longer term trend of weight loss as Energy's weighting is now only back to its highest level since July. Opposite of Energy, Consumer Discretionary is on pace to lose weight for the first time since March.

> # A Month to Be Thankful For

> Heading into today with just three trading days left in November, the average Russell 1,000 stock was up 17.44% month to date. As shown below, not one of the five largest stocks is up even close to 17% on the month. For a market that had recently been driven higher in large part because of the five mega-cap Tech names, November has seen the mega-caps stall a bit while the rest of the market has seen broad participation. This is the type of breadth that market bulls have been waiting and hoping for.

> Of the 35 largest stocks in the Russell 1,000, Tesla (TSLA) is up the most so far this month with a gain of 43%. The other big winners include Chevron (CVX), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA). Not one stock in the top 35 is down on the month, but the ones that are up the least are Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), and Home Depot (HD).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/largeststocks.png))**

> Looking at sectors, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1,000 is up 46% month-to-date but still down 27% year-to-date. Three other sectors have seen their stocks average MTD gains of more than 20%: Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate. Stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors are up the least on an average basis this month, but even these underperformers are still up more than 5%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/avgpctchg.png))**

> There are 37 stocks in the Russell 1,000 up more than 50% so far in November. Below is a list of this month's biggest winners. Coty (COTY) and Nordstrom (JWN) stand out the most with gains of more than 100%, followed by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Empire State Realty (ESRT). The list of biggest winners this month is full of names that got hit hardest by COVID in areas like energy, travel, retail, and real estate. Notably, while these stocks are up an average of 68.5% in November, they're still down an average of 23% on the year. On a median basis, they're down even more year-to-date at -31.55%.

> # Biden - Best Since Reagan

> The market started off November on a positive note, and even after the election has continued to add to its gains. Through the close today (11/24), the S&P 500 is up 7.90% since the close on Election Day. Relative to every other Presidential election since the beginning of the S&P back in 1928, the three-week performance of the S&P 500 following this Election Day ranks as the second-best of all time. It came down right to the wire, but the only other US President to see a stronger market reaction to their election (or re-election) was Ronald Reagan in 1980 (7.97%). Behind Reagan and Biden, the only other Presidents where the S&P 500 experienced an upside move of 5%+ in reaction to their elections were Hoover in 1928 and Clinton in 1996.

> On the downside, the most negative reaction of the market in the three weeks after Election Day was the 14.75% decline following President Obama's election in 2008. In addition to Obama, the S&P 500's four other three-week downside moves of more than 5% came after the elections of Truman in 1948, the election of George W Bush in 2000 (although at the time it was unknown who was the winner of that election), the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, and Dwight D Eisenhower's re-election in 1956.

> In aggregate, the S&P 500 hasn't historically responded all that great in the three weeks after a Presidential election. For every one since 1928, the median return of the S&P 500 in the three weeks after Election Day has been a gain of just 0.35%. Breaking out returns by party, in the three weeks after a Democratic candidate is elected, the S&P 500's median performance is a decline of 1.11% compared to a median gain of 3.04% when a Republican is elected.

> # DJIA 1,000 Point Thresholds

> What a wild year 2020 has been! With the DJIA closing above 30,000 today, it was the second first-time upside break of a 1,000 point threshold this year. While there have only been two new upside crosses of 1,000 point thresholds, due to the sharp pullback in March from the pandemic that briefly took the DJIA below 19,000 on a closing basis, there have actually been 12 different upside 1,000 point thresholds at some point in the year.

> The table below lists the first time that the DJIA closed above each 1,000 point threshold in its history along with the total number of times the index has crossed that level on a closing basis throughout history. The thousand point level that has seen the most crosses on a closing basis was 11,000 (87 crosses) while 10,000 ranks second at 67.

> Obviously, the higher the DJIA goes, the less impactful a move of 1,000 points becomes. At current levels, 1,000 points represents just 3.3%, which is really nothing more than a very bad day in the market. Given the diminishing impact of 1,000 points in the DJIA these days, their significance declines. Even still, the twelve new 1,000-point crosses since the 2016 election has given the President (who has publicly discussed the stock market more than any other President in history) plenty of ammunition to tweet about.

> # 30,000 Reasons To Be Thankful

> As 2020 winds down, it has been an extremely tough year on all of us. Still, there are many reasons to be thankful and today we will share some reasons investors should be thankful.

> Stocks have had one of the largest reversals ever in 2020, something to be thankful for. In fact, this could be the first year ever to see the S&P 500 down more than 30% peak-to-trough and finish higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.25.20-Revised-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> We should also be thankful that Congress was split in 2020, likely marking the 11th consecutive year the S&P 500 gained under a split Congress. Gridlock is good they tell us and that very well could be true yet again.

> Want something else to be thankful for? We likely will have a split Congress for another two years after the two Georgia runoffs are official.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-2-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

> Let’s be thankful that it is looking like stocks once again will be higher the year a President is up for re-election. In fact, you have to go back to FDR in the ‘40s the last time the S&P 500 was lower for the year when a President was up for re-election.

> We are thankful that we are in a new bull market, which if history plays out once again, could have a lot of life left to it. In fact, the average bull market has lasted more than five years.

> “Let’s be thankful that the huge move off the March lows was a major clue of more strength,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We noted at the time (many different ways) that the enormous move we saw off the March lows likely suggested significantly higher prices, while many ignored the market signals and instead looked for a re-test for months on end.”

> The 20-days off the March lows was the second best 20-day rally ever and sure enough, the returns have been very strong.

> We are finally seeing many stocks participate in this bull market, another reason to be thankful. In fact, the Value Line Arithmetic Index recently made new all-time highs. This index is a great look at what the ‘average’ stock is doing and is a sign that this move isn’t being led by just a few large cap tech stocks.

> Let’s be thankful that the NYSE Cumulative Advance/Decline line is at new highs. This looks at how many stocks are going up versus down and new highs are a sign of very healthy participation.

> Emerging markets have started to turn higher and we are thankful that this group could be on the verge of a major breakout to new highs, clearing their peak from 2007. As we move into ’21, this is one group we think could continue to do quite well for investors.

> We upgraded our view on small caps in September and the Russell 2000 Index is currently on pace to have its best monthly return ever. Investors should be thankful that this group is finally participating, as there are many more small caps than large caps, another sign of improving breadth, while small caps are also more domestic by nature and could be suggesting a strong US economy next year.

""If you get a job at Bank of America, you’ll make $41,000,” Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan says.

Effective on May 1, the minimum wage will be raised to $17 and will go higher in increments for the next two years, according to the company.",2019-04-09 22:58:25

JPMorgan’s new QuickAccept service lets businesses take card payments within minutes, either through a mobile app or a contactless card reader, and users will see sales hit their Chase accounts on the same day.

That fast funding is offered free, unlike competitors including Square, which typically take a day or more and charge a 1.5% fee to make instant transfers.

The bank designed its QuickAccept card reader, a hardware device that processes card payments via tap, dip or swipe, internally with the help of a team gained from its 2017 WePay acquisition.

JPMorgan will soon migrate “a large portion” of its more than three million small business customers to the new service, said Jen Roberts, CEO of the Chase business banking unit.

# **Stock rout may deepen in the week ahead as coronavirus impact starts to show up in economic data  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/28/stock-rout-to-deepen-as-coronavirus-impact-starts-to-show-up-in-data.html)**
*****
> Stock investors just experienced one of the nastiest weeks in history that recorded the S&P 500′s fastest correction on record, but hold on tight, the market might have more room to fall as the coronavirus damage starts to creep into upcoming economic data, analysts warned.
*****
> Major U.S. stock averages suffered their worst week since the financial crisis as fears about the coronavirus disrupting the global economy scared investors away from risk assets. However, stocks might still be searching for a bottom next week when investors grapple with a slew of economic data potentially dragged down by the outbreak.
*****
> The Institute for Supply Management will release its manufacturing gauge on Monday. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will publish its latest Beige Book on Wednesday, which will detail anecdotal information on current economic conditions. Many expect U.S. manufacturing to have taken a hit from the coronavirus.
*****
> “Look out for ISM surveys and Beige Book for early signs of COVID-19 impact,” Michelle Meyer, Bank of America’s head of U.S. economics, said in a note Friday. “It will take time for the ‘hard’ economic data to show the impact but we are already seeing evidence in early economic indicators.”
*****
> Weekend action?
> The outlook for the week could be changed this weekend by coronavirus headlines or by some sort of intervention by central banks. Expectations are rising on Wall Street that there could be some potential move from the Federal Reserve to get ahead of what could be another rough week.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank is monitoring the coronavirus and pledged action if necessary. Meanwhile, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh recommended the Fed act as quickly as Sunday before the markets reopen. The market is already pricing in a 100% chance of at least one rate cut at the Fed’s March policy meeting.
*****
> Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, is worried about the cascading effect of coronavirus hitting upcoming economic data points. “ISM manufacturing is going to be widely scrutinized,” he said.
*****
> The ISM manufacturing index rose to a reading of 50.9 last month, the highest level since July (Any reading above 50 signals expansion.) Bank of America expects ISM manufacturing to pull back to 50.0 and said Fed Beige Book may provide “early insight” into the U.S. economic impact from the deadly virus.
*****
> Cutting forecasts
> Next week, investors will also likely grapple with more warnings from major companies about broken supply chains and easing demand due to the outbreak.
*****
> Apple, Microsoft, Nike and United Airlines have all sounded alarms that they will not meet their earnings and revenue guidance because of the virus.
*****
> Wall Street strategists this week were quick to slash their forecasts on corporate earnings and the stock market. Barclays sees the S&P 500 to end the year at 3,000, down from a previous forecast of 3,300. The bank also expects a 2% drop in profits this year. Meanwhile, Goldman said it sees zero earnings growth for American companies in 2020.
*****
> To be sure, some believe the steep stock rout has gone too far too fast, betting on at least a small rebound.
*****
> “The level of panic has become very extreme and the level of downside price movement is pretty extreme. All of that is to me more of a sign that we are getting closer to the beginning of the end of it,” Paulsen said.
*****
> Another source of support could come from the Trump administration, where officials are discussing tax cuts, among other economic reactions, as one option to make up for the economic impact of the coronavirus, the Washington Post reported Friday.
*****
> Still, investors will have to be on edge for a while now with more virus headlines, as well as the key Super Tuesday Democratic primaries. Some notable investors including “bond king” Jeffrey Gundlach blamed the rise of Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders for helping accelerate massive sell-off.

# Gauging Potential Economic Impact of Covid-19

> The coronavirus outbreak—or Covid-19 —has caused significant market volatility over the past week. Our approach as always is to focus on economic fundamentals first, but the uncertainty around the scope of the outbreak has made it very difficult to assess potential impact. The situation clearly is unsettling for investors as more cases are reported across Europe and Asia, and the first case of community transmission has been reported in the United States. As this was written, the S&P 500 Index was 10% below its February 19 all-time high.

> “The Covid-19 outbreak continues to significantly disrupt economic activity in China and throughout Asia,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Given that China is such a big component of many global supply chains, we will almost certainly see weaker economic data globally over the next several months.”

> Even as the situation remains fluid and very uncertain, we want to provide some sense of the potential U.S. and global economic impact.

> **China**: If virus containment holds in China, which is our base case, we could see something like a 3–4 percentage point impact to Chinese economic growth in the first quarter—possibly 2–3% gross domestic product (GDP) growth rather than 5–6%—followed by a much more modest hit in the second quarter. We think we would see a return to trend growth by the third quarter of 2020. This scenario would put China’s 2020 GDP growth below the current 5.6% Bloomberg-tracked consensus, shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, and the Chinese government’s previous 6% annual target. In other words, China’s GDP growth in 2020 could end up closer to 5% than 6%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ.png?ssl=1))**

> United States: At this point, our base case is that any economic disruption in the United States may be modest and short-lived, as we expect domestic efforts at containment to be more successful and have less economic disruption than in China. The outbreak may trim 0.25–0.5% from U.S. GDP over the next couple of months due to global supply chain disruption, falling export demand, and decreased tourism. If evidence emerges over the next month or so that the virus is being contained successfully, as we expect, the economic impact would likely be at the better end of that range (0.25%). In that scenario, damage to business and consumer confidence would be limited, setting the stage for a potential second-quarter rebound. We believe our 1.75% U.S. GDP growth forecast may still be achievable.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ2.png?ssl=1))**

> **Global**: In the short-term, the collective hits to global GDP from China, South Korea, Japan, and Italy—the countries where the outbreak impact has been greatest to date—may comprise 0.2–0.3% of global GDP. Our latest global GDP forecast of 3.5% from our Outlook 2020 publication is probably a bit too high in light of the latest news. We expect to update or reaffirm our economic forecasts once we have more clarity around Covid-19 impact in the weeks ahead.

# Can the Market Bottom on a Friday?

> It's often said that equity markets can't bottom on a Friday. One of the reasons for this line of thinking is that during a market downturn, no one wants to hold onto or bid up equities into a weekend for fear of further bad news. It may just be a matter of semantics, but based on that line of reasoning, the more accurate way to phrase it would be that markets can't bottom on a Thursday or rallies can't begin on a Friday. However you want to think about it, the chart below shows the number of times the closing low of a 10%+ correction has occurred on various weekdays.

> Of the 97 S&P 500 corrections since 1928, the day of the week that has marked the low close of a 10%+ decline the least frequently is actually Wednesday with only 10. Behind Wednesday, Friday has been the second most infrequent day of the week for a bottom (15), and Thursday is the only other day of the week where the S&P 500 has made a low on a closing basis less than 20 times. The days of the week where the S&P 500 most frequently bottoms are Monday and Tuesday with 26 and 28, respectively.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022820-10-Corrections.png))**

> Regarding bear markets (20%+ declines), the trend is very similar. Bear markets have been the least likely to end on a Wednesday or Friday and most likely to end on a Tuesday.

# Dividend Stock Spotlight: S&P 500's Highest Yielders From The Sell-Off

> Given the lower prices of stocks, dividend yields have been on the rise over the past couple of weeks. The dividend yield of the S&P 500 now stands at 2.12% which is the highest since June 3rd of last year when it reached the same level, but only stayed there for a single day. Prior to that, yields were only higher during the Q4 2018 sell-off through February of 2019. At the beginning of the current sell-off on February 19th, the S&P 500's yield was 26 bps lower at 1.86%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Div-yield-sp.png))**

> Of the individual stocks in the index, there are now 81 stocks that have dividend yields of 4% or more. That compares to only 64 at the beginning of the sell-off. In the table below, we show the 25 highest yielders of the S&P 500 as well as the price change and change in the dividend yield since the 2/19 record high. As shown, there is only one stock, Macy's (M), that yields over 10% at the moment. This major retailer has fallen out of favor in the past few years but the stock has gotten crushed since the 2/19 market peak having fallen just under 21% in that time. That decline has raised the dividend yield by 2.44 percentage points, but there is one other stock that has seen its yield increase by even more. That stock is Occidental Petroleum (OXY), the second-highest yielder in the index (9.93%). Being an Energy name, OXY has fallen the most dramatically (-29.05%) since 2/19 of all the highest yielders.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Highest-Yielding-table1.png))**

> While there is a lot of overlap, in the table below we show the stocks that have seen their dividend yields rise the most as stocks have declined since 2/19. Again OXY and M top the list. While no other stocks have seen their dividend yields increase by more than 2 percentage points, there are another 17 who have risen by at least 1 percentage point. Notably, two cruise line stocks, Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) find themselves on this list. Carnival (CCL) now yields 6.28% while Royal Caribbean (RCL) yields 4.05%.

# The Biggest Losers (and a few winners)

> It is no secret that energy stocks have gotten crushed this year, and the list of the 25 worst-performing stocks in the Russell 1000 since the previous record close on February 19th is a prime example of this. Seven energy stocks find themselves on this list, two of which, Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Kosmos Energy (KOS), take up the number one and two spots having fallen 45.73% and 41.95%, respectively since 2/19. CHK had already been weak headed into the broader market sell-off with a YTD loss on 2/19 over 40%; the past week has added fuel to the fire as it is now down 68.5% YTD. Continental (CLR), Centennial Resource Development (CDEV), Transocean (RIG), and Apergy (APY) are other energy stocks that were down 20% or more on the year headed into this sell-off, and each one has fallen another 20%+ since the 19th. While most of the other biggest losers since 2/19 had already been down on the year, there are some that have seen their gains in 2020 get erased due to this sell-off like Nutanix (NTNX), Qurate Retail (QRTEA), Anaplan (PLAN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Chemours (CC), and CommScope (COMM). Some other notable losers of this group have been those heavily reliant on travel like American Airlines (AAL) and the cruise line stocks like Norwegian (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Worst.png))**

> Given how breadth has been over the past week, it may not come as any surprise that since the February 19th high there are only 18 stocks of 1000 in the Russell 1000 index that are higher. Four of those are up less than one percent. In the table below we show all of these stocks. Given the sell-off has centered around coronavirus fears, it is sensical that a coronavirus vaccine developer Moderna (MRNA) is the best performing stock since 2/19. What is amazing is there was not much momentum with this name headed into the sell-off. As of 2/19, the stock was actually down 3.27% year to date, but as the Covid-19 saga has moved along it is now up well north of 30% on the year. A few other health care names like Regeneron (REGN) and Gilead (GILD) have also benefited from the coronavirus.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Best.png))**

> The histogram below shows the distribution of performance of Russell 1000 stocks since 2/19. As mentioned above, there are very few stocks in the index that are up since the 2/19 high. The highest share of stocks are down between 10% and 15% while the next highest share are down between 5% and 10%. Of the worst decliners, there are 75 stocks that have fallen over 20%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/hist.png))**

> Looking at the individual sectors, again Energy was extremely weak even before equities sold off. On 2/19, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1000 in that sector was down 15.6% YTD. While they hadn't tipped into the red yet, Consumer Staples were only up 1 bp.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/YTD-of-219.png))**

> Since the 2/19 high for the US equity market, the average stock in the Russell 1,000 is down well over 10%. The average Energy stock is down the most at -21%, followed by Communication Services and Technology at -13%. Consumer Staples stocks have performed the best with an average decline of 8.9%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Since-219.png))**

> This leaves every sector down year-to-date. Utilities have generally outperformed only falling 2.3%, but the sector is sitting on a loss nonetheless. Of the worst sectors, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Materials, and of course Energy have fallen 10% or more.

# Global Equity Benchmarks Distance From YTD Highs

> The recent equity sell-off has clearly been global in nature as concerns of a global pandemic rise. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the way equities have sold off recently is that the country that has been hardest hit by the virus is closer to its YTD high than any other major global equity benchmark. The chart below shows the distance that each major global equity benchmark has declined relative to its YTD high. China's Shanghai Composite is down just 4.45%, which is better than any other country shown. Sure, you could argue that the Chinese government is manipulating the market and prohibiting investors from selling, but even the ETF that tracks the CSI 300 (ASHR) is down less than 6%, so anyone could go in and trade at these levels. Manipulated or not, the numbers are the numbers.

> At the bottom of the list, Brazil's Ibovespa index is down more than any other country at 11.6% and that country has only reported one confirmed case so far. With respect to US indices, the Russell 2000 is down the second most of any major global benchmark (-9.19%), while the Nasdaq is down the fourth most at 8.68%. Even the S&P 500 is down close to 8%. These weak US readings come in a backdrop where there have only been 57 confirmed cases and all but a couple are instances where Americans contracted the virus outside of the United States and have been brought to the US under quarantine.

# Just Four S&P 500 Stocks Up This Week

> There's still another day left in the week, but unless things improve on Friday this will go down as one of the worst weeks for US equities in history. Since WWII, there have only been four other weeks where the S&P 500 was down more than 10% in a given week. On a related note, there are also only four stocks in the entire S&P 500 that are positive for the week! Leading the way higher, Regeneron (REGN) is up a healthy 7.1% while Gilead (GILD) is up just over 4%. Behind these two, the only other stocks that are higher now than they were at last Friday's close are Clorox (CLX) and CME Group (CME).

> On the downside, there are a lot more losers, but in the interest of space, below we have only listed the 17 stocks in the S&P 500 that are down over 20% this week alone. Looking through the names on the list, the cruise lines are well represented with Royal Caribbean (RCL), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), and Carnival (CCL). Besides these names, American Airlines (AAL) is down 26%, while Live Nation (LYV) is down 22.2%.

> One thing we've heard a number of people argue the last few days is that some of the weakness this week is related to the increasing likelihood that Bernie Sanders wins the Democratic nomination. If that's the case, why is not a single one of the worst-performing stocks from the Health Care sector, and why is the Health Care sector the third best performing sector this week and one of just four that is not down 10% so far this week?

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",2020-03-01 02:52:52
1444,PSA for my fellow new traders: Don'tpanic buy or sell,1086,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gzo7bo/psa_for_my_fellow_new_traders_dontpanic_buy_or/,195,"I'm a relatively new trader here but after reading about all those salty threads yesterday about how I should've bought this or I shouldn't have bought that, this is a PSA for you fellow noobs. Keep your cool. 

All the ""could have been"" moments will only make you more upset and cloud your judgement. Don't let missing out on a winning lottery ticket sour still modest and respectable gains.

If you're betting more than you can afford to lose, you're not doing it right either and the emotional weight of it could also cloud your judgment.

Plan strategically. Invest dispassionately. Happy trading.",2020-06-10 01:28:26
1445,For those who are wondering when is a good time to invest...,1084,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fhj1eb/for_those_who_are_wondering_when_is_a_good_time/,469,"**Disclaimer:** No one knows when the bottom of this market is going to hit. I implore all of you to do your homework before making any purchases. Keep in mind these thoughts are from a long-term investor. If you are a short-term investor this may not mesh with what you think. 

The time is now. While everyone else is panicking this is your chance to find good discounts. Just make sure to follow some simple rules:

1. If you have no idea what to invest in, invest in big names like Coke (KO), Microsoft (MSFT), Bank of America (BAC), or ETF's such as SPY, QQQ, VOO etc. It is really important that you don't put all your eggs in 1 basket so spread out your investments among the big names you know or an ETF to cover you. **This is the ""set it and forget it"" route. Invest in these types of companies/ETF's and don't look at your account for a while.**
2. If you are feeling a little more gutsy you can invest in some companies that have been hit hard by the world events. Think banks, oil, leisure companies (like carnival (CCL)), think Airlines (DAL, AAL, etc.) Exxon (XOM), Chevron (CVX), BP (BP), and others. **I don't advise you doing this unless you can stomach heavy negative swings. I can't stress this enough.**
3. Remember you are going to see wild swings from day to day. Don't let positive days make you feel like you know everything, and conversely, don't let red days make you feel like you have lost it all and you never should have done this in the first place. It is really important to keep your emotions out of the market. which leads to my next point.
4. **Only invest money you can afford to invest (aka: you will be fine without that money for at least 12 months)**. If you can't afford it and you invest you are basically gambling and there is no way to be rational with money you cannot afford to be without.

Right now is a great time to invest because there are companies out there that are heavily discounted that normally aren't this cheap. Do your best to take advantage of this moment, and try to keep a cool head while the general public is not calm.

Edit: Wow RIP my inbox -- I want to first say to some who have been suggesting. **I don't know when the bottom is coming and I am not trying to call or predict the bottom.** Anyone who is telling you they know when the bottom is coming -- don't listen to them. I highly advise all who are interested to look into  [Dollar Cost Averaging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp). This is mainly the strategy I am using during this time, I am not advocating sinking your entire liquidity into one day!

**Also since I have your attention let me hijack my own post and help others!**

1. If you are brand new to investing please visit the sidebar!!! it has fantastic info! (like this link for example:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index))
2. If you would like a resource that covers a lot of investing basics -- [www.investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com) check out the education tab, and try out their simulator (really helped me when  I first started).
3. Please do your DD -- [www.finviz.com](https://www.finviz.com) is fantastic for this (and if you don't know how to read a lot of the acronyms or what they mean, you can look them up on investopedia!)

(DD),1075,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/if9tmj/beyond_meat_bynd_fundamental_analysis_with_my/,369,"I've seen a lot of bullish and bearish talk on Beyond Meat on this sub and I decided to do a deep dive into the company's fundaments. It's a cool company with a bold vision and I hope that this analysis provides value for some people.

**NOTE** I own a few shares of BYND and I do not recommend you buy without doing your own research

-----------------------

**Reasons** **for** **plant** **based** **meat** **market** **growth**

----------------------

1. Consumer behavior is changing along with worries of beef consumption due to climate change. 

2. Increasing awareness of health benefits provided by plant based meat. 

3. Potential for lower prices due to economies of scale as plant-based meat industry grows

4. Logical economic efficiency in plant-based meat production versus animal based meat. 

Plant based: Agriculture → meat

Animal based: Agriculture → animal → meat

----------------------

**Reasons** **why** **Beyond** **Meat** **will** **lead** **the** **plant** **based** **meat** **industry**

--------------------

1. Current market leader, incredible growth numbers and market share gains over time, despite traditional meat companies starting plant programs. 

2. Strategic partnerships with businesses such as Del Taco, Dunkin, Carl's Jr, Subway, Denny’s, Hardees, TGI Fridays, KFC, Kroger, WholeFoods, Starbucks, Sam’s Club, Costco, Target, Publix, Walmart & many more

3. Strong management team. Ethan Brown is a charismatic, visionary CEO. 

4. Beyond is the most recognized plant-based meat brand in the U.S. According to the most recent conference call, 5% of U.S. households purchased Beyond Meat products (Up 33% from January) and the repeat purchase rate rose to 50%, from 45% from January. 

5. Beyond has seen significant growth in China, with their launch into Starbucks, Yum Brands China, and grocery locations such as Freshippo (operated by Alibaba)

6. 7% of revenue currently goes towards R&D in order to ride the lowering cost curve towards lower prices than animal based meat.

7. Management aims for the start of 2024 to have lower price than animal based meat in one of beef, pork or poultry. 

--------------------

**Risks** **and** **potential** **downfalls**

-----------------------

1. Beyond’s brand name could be tarnished and cause them to lose market share.

2. Legacy meat companies can outspend Beyond and take market share of plant based meat future

3. Consumers could be less receptive to plant based meat and climate change/health benefits could be seen as overblown.

4. Beyond isn’t able to innovate enough to lower costs & prices in line with animal based meat

5. Studies come out showing Beyond’s products have adverse health effects. (Despite the recent University of Michigan study showing the health benefits of Beyond)

6. Plant based market never overtakes animal based market (3 & 4)

7. Plant based meat becomes comoticized and Beyond is unable to become consistently profitable.

----------------

**Price** **Targets** (**5** **year** **timeline**)

------------------

1. Current market cap of $7.9 billion, compared with Tyson Foods’ $24 billion (3X)

2. Current sales estimate of $500 million expected 2020 compared with Tyson’s $43 billion (86X). Revenue is best measure of 
valuation due to high growth 

3. 2023 sales estimate of $1.23 billion compared with Tyson’s $45 billion expected (assuming linear growth). (36X). 

4. 2023 sales estimates could easily be much higher than 1.23 billion. Especially if costs & prices keep declining + more strategic partnerships develop. I’m estimating sales closer to $2 billion in my bull case. This would mean a P/S ratio of 4. 

5. If the P/S ratio is around 15 in 2023, Beyond would be undervalued by 3.75X in 2023.

-----------------------

**Bull** **Case**: **$804** **price** **target** (in 2025)

P/S of 10, Revenue of $5 billion, 58.5% annual revenue growth

-----------------------

1) Total plant based meat market size rises from 12.1 billion in 2019 to 100 billion in 2025 (from 0.605% to 5% of global meat market)

* Price of plant based meat is lower than that of animal based meat in the chicken, poultry and beef market (management target is for one of these markets by 2024). 

* Climate change & health concerns drastically push demand higher, government incentives are also a possibility under a more progressive 2024 legislation. 

2) Beyond’s 2.5% 2019 global market share in the plant based meat market rises to 5% market share in 2025. 

* More big time strategic partnerships with major foodservice companies (possibly McDonalds) 

* Brand penetration continues to increase

* Internationally distribution network expands

* Substantial expansion into China and Southeast Asia
 
* Competitors fail to innovate at the same rate of Beyond and have higher prices than Beyond

3) Price/Sales ratio of 10, implying high future growth, but a lower rate than the 58.5% annual growth rate from the last 5 years (2020-2025). 

* Their current price/sales ratio is 19.5  

* Beyond deserves a much higher P/S ratio than traditional meat companies. Their current gross margin of 35% is three times greater than Tyson 12% gross margin. 

* Net profit margin will increase over time as they leverage economies of scale with the growth of their operation. 

---------------------

**Median** **Case**: **$385** **price** **target** (in 2025)

P/S of 10, Revenue of $2.4 billion, 37% annual revenue growth

-----------------------

1) Total plant based market size rises from 12.1 billion in 2019 to 60 billion in 2025. 
(from 0.605% to 3% of global meat market)

* Plant based meat is lower than that of animal based meat in one of the chicken, poultry or pork markets. (management target is for one of these markets by 2024). 

* Climate change and health concerns increase demand moderately over time, governments don’t intervene in market pricing with subsidies 

2) Beyond’s 2.5% 2019 market share in the plant based meat market rises to 4% market share in 2025. 

* More big time strategic partnerships with major foodservice companies (possibly McDonalds) 

* Brand recognition continues to increase

* Internationally distribution network expands 

* Expansion into China grows, but not as quickly

* Competitors fail to innovate at the same rate of Beyond and have higher prices than Beyond

3) Price/Sales ratio of 10, implying high future growth, but a lower rate than the 37% annual rate from the last 5 years (2020-2025). 

* Their current price/sales ratio is 19.5
 
* Beyond deserves a much higher P/S ratio than traditional meat companies. Their current gross margin of 35% is three times greater than Tyson 12% gross margin. 

--------------------

**Bear** **Case**: **$108** **price** **target** (in 2025)

7.5 P/S, $900 million revenue, 12.5% annual revenue growth

-----------------------

1) Total plant based market size rises from 12.1 billion in 2019 to 30 billion in 2025. 
((from 0.605% to 1.5% of global meat market)

* Prices of Beyond Meat’s plant based products are slightly above that of animal based products

* Climate change and health benefits don’t have a significant increase on demand

2) Beyond’s 2.5% 2019 market share in the plant based meat market rises slightly to 3% market share in 2025. 

* Beyond loses traction in increasing partnerships and strikes out on companies such as McDonalds. 

* Brand recognition is not a significant factor 

* International growth slows down

* Beyond strikes out in China

* Competition increases and stunts Beyond’s market share growth

3) Price/Sales ratio of 7.5, implying slowing future growth.

* The 12.5% annual growth rate over the last five years shows signs of slowing down.

* Although Beyond still has a higher P/S ratio compared to traditional meat companies, a slowing growth rate limits their potential. 

* The 3X gross margin compared to Tyson is the reason why the P/S ratio isn’t lower than 7.5.

I hope you all learn something from this post! Any other Beyond shareholders or Beyond haters out there?

1449,"Opinion/Rant: When there is a true bottom/recession, buying won't be easy",1075,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g2m075/opinionrant_when_there_is_a_true_bottomrecession/,307,"I see a lot of posters on here, social media, friends and family, saying the same stuff (especially new ""investors""). ""This market is bs!"".

Many people are pissed, because according to them, the market is reacting correctly.

These people think because when there's a global pandemic, the market has to plummet, and you just buy everything at a discount and get rich, right? Shocker... 99% of investors are thinking the same thing.

All I can say is, when there is a true bottom and fear, buying won't be easy at all (unless you and your family are already rich with job security and healthy). Once most people burn through their savings; have to make decisions like which bill to pay first, should I keep on investing and take on debt, or pay my debts first?.... Once those kind of scary decisions arise and most people lose their faith in the market is when we will be in true bottom territory.

Just a little rant because people think it's as easy as just being an opportunist.  It's not. Because once the opportunity finally comes, you probably won't have the resources to make the moves.

&#x200B;

EDIT 1:

Looks like I offended a lot of people, which was not my intention. I am not trying to predict the bottom at all. I know I don't know.

All I was saying was is, when this ""bottom"" happens, it will be at a point where most people are scared. Whether it be because they are in debt or because they have lost faith in the market. It's not going to be as easy ""this is cheap, buy now, I will get returns a few years from now"". There's a lot of new investors thinking it's that easy.

Risks aren't easy. Those 10% drops we saw several weeks ago was child's play. You'll know what I mean if/when it happens. When you are legit scared to put money in because you lost faith in the market and economy.

I'm an Average Joe. I'm continuing do DCAing and buying at my usual rate.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2:

I guess I offended people with this as well:

""unless you and your family are already rich with job security and healthy""

That definitely came out wrong. I didn't mean that to rich shame.

I still believe in America. And there will still be opportunities. But once again, I think the idea of just buying at this bottom is easier said than done, especially for people who aren't already wealthy or financially stable. And for those that do have the ballz to buy big in a fearful market, I think 9 out of 10 (and that's being VERY generous), will get burnt trying to make it during these hard times. But that's another topic.

Good luck to everybody. Invest smart.",2020-04-17 06:40:39

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 30th, 2020.

# **What could be ‘shocker’ economic reports may test stocks in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/27/what-could-be-shocker-economic-reports-may-test-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Everything from auto sales to manufacturing surveys and employment data in the coming week will likely paint a bleak picture of how much the first weeks of the coronavirus shutdown have already hit the economy.
*****
> Market turbulence is expected to remain high, though volatile moves in the past week were largely to the upside. The S&P 500, by Thursday, had soared 20% intraday off its Monday low, before giving up some gains Friday. For the week, the S&P 500 was up 10.3% at 2,541.
*****
> The market’s rip higher ignited a debate about whether stocks have now bottomed, and that discussion will carry on into the week ahead. Some major investors like billionaire investor Leon Cooperman and BlackRock’s Rick Rieder believe stocks may have hit their lows. Other strategists say the market needs to see a retest before a bottom can be called.
*****
> “It’s amazing to me that people are so bullish when virus cases are accelerating and economic growth is deteriorating,” said Richard Bernstein, CEO Richard Bernstein Advisors. “I could see it if cases peaked out, and the economy is troughing.”
*****
> # It’s the economy
> In the coming week, the big number to watch could again be Thursday’s weekly jobless claims, up a record 3.2 million for the week ended March 21, as the shutdown of stores, restaurants, and other businesses across the country resulted in immediate layoffs. 
*****
> Economists expect several million more claims to be filed for the past week, and they are looking at that new claims report as potentially more important than Friday’s March employment report. The survey week for the March jobs report was ahead of some of the major shutdowns by the states most impacted by the virus. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls to drop by 56,000 in March, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> Other data could show some of the early signs of an economy brought to a standstill. There are auto sales and ISM manufacturing releases on Wednesday, both March reports. Service sector data will be released Friday.
*****
> Market focus will be more intensely focused on the economic data, shifting from the $2 trillion aid bill, signed by President Donald Trump on Friday. Economists expect the economy already may be in a slowdown and that it should trough with a double-digit decline in the nation’s gross domestic product in the second quarter.
*****
> Vehicle sales will be reported Wednesday, and sales are expected to have come to a near standstill even though shuttered dealerships continue trying to deliver autos to buyers.
*****
> For “car sales, I would think the drop would be more precipitous,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “They shut down in every major market. Even though they’re offering deliveries and all that stuff, it’s going to be a shocker ... large double digit decline.”
*****
> Auto sales were at an annualized pace of 16.8 million in February, and some economists say the number in March could be closer to 12 million.
*****
> Congress passed a $2 trillion aid package to help put cash in the hands of workers and companies, so they can weather the effects of a shutdown.
*****
> Separately, the Fed has delivered a massive amount of monetary stimulus that has helped ease up some of the problems in illiquid credit and even the Treasury market.  It has been buying Treasury and mortgage-backed securities at a record pace of $70 billion a day, and markets are focused on when the Fed will alter the size of its purchases, which are open-ended.
*****
> “This week, plus last week was more than $600 billion. It’s monumental.” said Michael Schumacher, director, rates at Wells Fargo. The Fed said it was reducing the purchases to $60 billion a day, which is the amount it had been buying in a one-month period.
*****
> # Stimulus one-two punch
> The double-barreled boost to markets from the Fed’s policy and the prospect of the fiscal spending package helped fire up the mid-week rally in stocks. 
*****
> “Even though the market, from the intraday low on March 23 through the intraday high on March 26, soared more than 20%, which to many is the definition of a new bull market, this low must be sustained before a new bull market can be crowned,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “We’ve got to maintain this recent low, in my opinion, for another six months before we can call this another bull market.”
*****
> Stovall said the S&P 500 is often higher in April, though this year it may not be. The S&P is down about 14% for the month of March so far. Since World War II,  April has been the second best month for the S&P, which has been up an average 1.5% and higher 71% of the time.
*****
> The big rally in stocks this week is not an unusual occurrence in a bear market, Stovall said. “There have been multiple times in history - 1973/1974, 2001/2002, and combined with 2008, 2009, that we saw 20 plus percent rallies before ultimately setting an even lower low.”
*****
> Stovall said it’s likely there will be a lower low. “The only think that causes me to say we may not retest the bottom is everybody is saying we need to retest the bottom,” he said. The S&P hit a low of 2,191 before bouncing higher.
*****
> # Credit un-crunching
> In addition to its Treasury and mortgage purchases, the Fed has cut rates to zero, added liquidity in the repo market and committed to creating vehicles to help corporate paper, municipal bonds and corporate debt.
*****
> “Stress levels in financial markets have receded in a meaningful way this week, thanks in no small part to the Fed’s aggressive moves.  Leveraged loans rebounded somewhat in price yesterday, and the MBS market is seeing broadening improvement (though it is far from normal),” noted Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.
*****
> Stanley said the Fed may not need to buy corporate bonds for now, based on new issuance activity in that market this week.

# Will the Fed’s Bold Moves Keep Yields from Rising?

> With the major stock market indexes all entering a bear market this month, it’s no surprise that stocks have stolen most of the spotlight. However, actions taken by the Federal Reserve (Fed) to support what may be considered the safest part of the bond market, US Treasuries, may actually have more lasting implications for investors’ portfolios.

> From February 19 through midday March 9, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell an incredible 125 basis points (1.25%), briefly reaching an all-time low of just 0.31%. In fact, the 14-day relative strength index RSI on the 10-year yield, a technical measure of momentum, was more oversold than at any point since 1971. Since then yields came roaring back, trading as high as 1.27%, before fading back to near 0.8% currently.

> It is logical to think that the incredibly bold moves from the Fed, including unlimited Treasuries purchases, will help keep yields down. But could yields actually rise from here after the Fed writes the bond market a blank check? History says yes, which seems counter-intuitive. For investors, it’s important to keep in mind that the combination of low starting yields and rising interest rates may lead to meager future fixed income returns.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, following prior announcements of quantitative easing (Fed securities purchases), yields have actually risen. Part of that story is the market pricing in higher inflation expectations as a result of the “money printing.” Another piece is the market becoming more confident in economic recovery. “The massive injection of liquidity into the bond market by the Federal Reserve—in concert with fiscal stimulus—surely helps shore up the economy and credit marekts for an eventual recovery,” noted LPL Financial Sr. Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> LPL Research forecasts the 10-year Treasury yield will end 2020 in the range of 1.25-1.75%. Outcomes outside of that range are certainly possible depending on how long it takes to get the pandemic under control.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Yields-after-QE.png?ssl=1))**

> If the roughly $2 trillion in fiscal stimulus is added to the Fed’s securities purchases, and additional lending capacity that the Fed’s new programs create, the economy will get a $5-6 trillion jolt in the next several months to help us get through this crisis to the other side. In a $22 trillion US economy, that is significant and far exceeds the stimulus that dug the economy out of a ditch after the 2008-2009 financial crisis. This human crisis is not over unfortunately, but the bold moves from policymakers should help lessen the blow. The size of hit became evident in Thursday’s massive spike in jobless claims. The economic data will get worse before it gets better, but visibility into the peak of this crisis is starting to come into view and markets—both stocks and bonds—may be beginning to sniff that out.

*****

# Making Sense of Skyrocketing Jobless Claims

> Weekly new jobless claims were reported this morning, and to no one’s surprise they rose to levels thought unimaginable just a few weeks ago. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 3.3 million people filed new claims for unemployment benefits in the week ending March 21, almost 5 times the previous high of 695,000 set in 1982.

> “The personal and economic disruptions represented by the latest new claims number are staggering,” said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “This is a genuine human crisis, and a robust response from the Federal Reserve and Congress seems appropriate. Unfortunately, we do expect more numbers like this in the coming months. At the same time, markets are forward looking and will be more focused on how quickly we might be able to get to the other side.” Per LPL’s Chart of the Day:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-Chart-20-03-26-New-Claims.png?ssl=1))**

> While the number of new claims is extraordinary, it’s not entirely unexpected. The United States and countries across the globe have shut down entire segments of their economies in an effort to delay or disrupt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the jobs most impacted by social-distancing measures, such as cashiers, restaurant workers, and hotel staff, are in the services sector, which now makes up about 80% of the jobs in the United States.

> There is no silver lining in a number like this, but there is reason for hope. The US economy was not in a recession prior to the global spread of COVID-19. Workers are not being let go because of some structural fault in the economy or a financial crisis. As a result, when the slowdown ends, we may not see the extended hiring delay that has typically followed recessions. In fact, a surge in demand may require extra hiring, although it may not take place until people are fully confident that social distancing is no longer necessary.

> Markets may not be responding to the dramatic numbers seen this morning, but they have been absorbing the rapidly changing economic expectations it represents over the last few weeks. We’ll see a lot of this over the next couple of months: historic numbers with markets seemingly unmoved. But it’s not because they’re indifferent. Economic data is slow moving and backward looking, while our economic reality has been changing at an unprecedented pace. Even new unemployment claims, which are released weekly, seem somewhat stale. Markets will still be reacting to shifting expectations of the depth and duration of the slowdown, as well as the effectiveness of policies to help businesses and workers get to the other side.

*****

# Market Volatility Stresses Liquidity

> The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented volatility in recent weeks that has investors and traders scrambling to assess the economic and market impact of the aggressive containment measures.

> This past week the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which measures the implied 30-day volatility of the S&P 500 Index based on options contracts, measured its highest reading since its inception at over 82—besting the prior high set during the financial crisis in 2008-2009, shown in the chart below. That is saying something.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-volatility.png?ssl=1))**

> As market participants have sought shelter from the storm in traditional safe havens such as US Treasuries, gold, or cash, we have seen signs that liquidity has dried up. All that means is buyers have become more tentative, demanding lower prices to get trades done due to the historic volatility and heightened uncertainty. That in turn can lead to wider bid-ask spreads for market participants—both retail investors and institutions—and we sometimes see a dollar of value selling for 95 cents, if not less.

> We have seen some of this in the corporate bond markets in recent days. Even short-maturity, high-quality investment grade corporate bond strategies have seen market prices disconnect with their fair value, as measured by net asset value (NAV). That metric essentially adds up the value of individual bonds in a portfolio such as an exchange-traded fund, which should in theory match the market price of the security that we all see on our screens.

> “In volatile markets, quality items go on sale to clear the racks because there aren’t a lot of shoppers walking through the malls,” noted Ryan Detrick, LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist. “Improving liquidity in all markets can help restore investor confidence after being shaken the past few weeks.”

> At their worst, these conditions can translate into serious dislocations, such as those experienced during the financial crisis when banks didn’t trust each other enough to make overnight loans and credit froze up. Short-term lending is a necessary lubricant for economic activity.

> Investors can get hurt selling into these dislocated markets. This is where the Federal Reserve (Fed) comes in. The programs the Fed launched on Monday, March 23—including buying large amounts of corporate bonds—are aimed at restoring health to credit markets. The central bank’s aggressive bond purchases (as much as needed) should help restore orderly trading in corporate bonds and narrow spreads, a measure of risk, which have widened significantly in recent weeks. As shown in the chart below, spreads are still well short of 2008-2009 highs.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Credit-spreads-blog-chart-for-3-24-20.png?ssl=1))**

> There is some other good news here. These dislocations can present opportunities for buyers to get discounts they may not otherwise see in normally functioning market environments. We aren’t suggesting running out and buying securities trading at the biggest discounts to their intrinsic value. Instead, we are highlighting that attractive opportunities are emerging in the corporate bond market, particularly in strategies focused on strong companies that may emerge on the other side of this crisis as leaders of the economic rebound.

*****

# Time In The Market Versus Timing The Market

> The incredible volatility continues, with the S&P 500 Index now in one of its worst bear markets ever, along the way making the quickest move from an all-time high to down 30% at only 22 days. What is a long-term investor to do?

> “Although market timing is very alluring to investors, especially after the past few weeks, the reality is timing things incorrectly can set you back significantly,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, if you started in 1990 and missed the best day of the year each year for the S&P 500, your annual return was nearly cut in half.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the annualized return for the S&P 500 from 1990 to 2019 was 7.7%. Yet, if all you missed was the best day of the year, that return dropped to only 3.9%. Miss the best two days of each year, and you were up less than 1% a year. Taking it to the extreme, if you missed the best 20 days of each year, you’d be down 27% per year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/chart-3.24.png?ssl=1))**

> No one can consistently pick the best or worst days of the year, so this is why it can be so dangerous for investors to miss time in the market by trying to time the market. If you miss one or two big days, compounded over time, this can greatly impact your portfolio.

*****

# Boeing (BA) Sends the Dow Flying

> Turnaround Tuesday has carried into hump day with the Dow up well over 5% again today as of this writing. As we mentioned in an earlier post, that means the Dow is on track for its first back-to-back up days for the first time since early February. Remarkably, even with only two consecutive up days, the index is closing in on exiting a bear market. For that to happen, the Dow would need to close above the 22,310.32 level which is 20% off of the bear market closing low (Monday's close at 18,591.93). At today's high, the Dow was less than 300 points or 1.32% from that level.

> As for the individual stocks contributing to the rally, Boeing (BA) deserves a lot of thanks. The stock has been hit very hard during the sell-off. Whereas the stock has traded in the mid-$300 for much of the past two years and up to mid-February, as of late last week BA had fallen below $100. That massive drop in price means that day to day movements in the stock would have a lesser impact on the level of the price-weighted Dow. In spite of this, BA has contributed over 400 points to the Dow's rally in the past two days alone! That is much more than any other stock in the index with the next biggest contributor being UnitedHealth (UNH) who's 335.44 point contribution comes as its share price is currently around $100 more than BA. BA's contribution is also almost 200 points more than those of McDonald's (MCD), Visa (V), and Apple (AAPL). Of all 30 Dow stocks, there is only one that is down over the past couple of days, subtracting from the index's rally: Walmart (WMT). Given WMT has held up fairly well recently, its performance is yet another example of investors' focus on the more beaten down names that we have noted earlier today and in last night's Closer.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",2020-03-29 01:38:56
1451,Jim Cramer's checklist of what an investor should analyze when researching a company - From the 1990s/2000s - Using Nike as an example - Taken from my schools archive,1061,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jsjdxt/jim_cramers_checklist_of_what_an_investor_should/,117,"“Bulls and Bears make money, but Hogs get slaughtered.”

1. There must be demand for the company’s products. Nike’s been creating demand for decades, thanks to the “cool factor” supported by sharp advertising and clothing that looks good, feels comfortable and lets everyone know you’re an athlete. 

2. The company’s total addressable market. In other words, how big the market is for its products. Cramer also likes to know where it sits in the pecking order. Nike is the dominant player in footwear and number two in apparel. 

3. Are there any catalysts that can power the stock higher? Nike has several catalysts, like the Summer Olympics. 

4. Other ways to look into the future. Nike has a company-specific key metric called future orders, which allows customers to order merchandise six months ahead.

5. The company’s ability to pass costs onto the customers. Nike made it clear in the conference call that it had no trouble passing on raw costs through price increases, Cramer said. 

6. It’s important to understand the geographic breakdown of the business. Nike’s fastest growing geographies are emerging markets, which is up 26 percent year-over-year. China is up 28 percent and the U.S. is up 21 percent. Western Europe and Japan are still challenging environments, but they’re offset by the strength elsewhere.

7. Wall Street loves accelerating revenue growth. Nike has this across multiple product categories in both developed and developing markets.

8. Inventory. When companies with retail components have too much inventory, it can be a problem since they’ll have to discount the older products before bringing in a new product. Nike’s unit inventory growth outpaced its sales growth, but since absolute unit levels have ""plateaued,"" Cramer is not concerned. 

9. Good companies are always reinventing themselves and their products. Nike is doing this, Cramer said, with new technology in its shoes and marketing. 

10. Company culture. Nike is focused on improving the way they work. This is the least important item. 

&#x200B;

When Jim Cramer worked at his hedge fund, he asked analysts the following eight questions: 

No. 1: What's goingto make this stock go up, besides the stock market?

No. 2: Why is it going to go up? Is there something time sensitive?

No. 3: Is this the best time to buy it?

No. 4: Have you missed a lot of the move? How much has the stock gone up without you? Is it extended on a technical basis?

No. 5: Should you wait until it comes down a bit more? What's the harm?

No. 6: What do you know about this stock that others are missing? Is your instinct to buy based on general knowledge, and you're working on a herd mentality? Have you listened to the conference calls and done the research, or are you flying blind?

No. 7: What do you actually know about the company and sector? Do you have personal knowledge? Do you know how the cloud works, what stock trades with what, or where it lies in the sector’s food chain?

No. 8: Do you like this stock more than others you own and why? Is there anything to get rid of before buying this stock?",2020-11-12 10:40:12

That exercise may have now entered the final stages, raising the odds for a 2021 breakout that signals another year of superior returns and a potential trip up to the $300 level.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

Microsoft stock has doubled in price since the end of 2018.

Institutional investors have been loading up on the stock in the fourth quarter

The stock could post superior returns for the third year in a row in 2021.

A symmetrical triangle breakout may have to wait for January tax-selling pressure to ease.

Compared with last year’s iPhone 11 line of phones, the iPhone 12 line is showing strong demand in China. The country is estimated to account for 35 to 45 per cent of global demand for the iPhone 12 Pro, according to a recent report from TF Securities International analyst Kuo Ming-Chi, who is known for his Apple analysis. There were between 7 million and 9 million pre-orders of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro globally during the first weekend of sales, according to Kuo.

The new iPhones have also proven to be a hot commodity on Chinese e-commerce sites. The available stock on JD.com sold out within 30 seconds after pre-orders started on October 16. And Alibaba, the parent company of the South China Morning Post, said that about 30 million users have searched for the new iPhones over the last 30 days on its Tmall marketplace. That is twice the search volume for the iPhone 11 in the same period last year.

Sales of the iPhone 12 could be aided by the fact that it is the first iPhone to support 5G after Apple skipped the feature last year. Sales of the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro reached an estimated 1.7 to 2 million units globally in the first 24 hours of pre-orders. The three iPhone 11 models only saw 500,000 to 800,000 units sold in the same period after pre-orders opened in September last year, according to the report from Kuo.

1462,Clean Energy ETFs - ICLN vs. QCLN vs. PBW - Investing for future growth - An in-depth comparison.,1033,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jgyye2/clean_energy_etfs_icln_vs_qcln_vs_pbw_investing/,129,"# Introduction:

This post will focus on breaking down the differences between 3 of the largest clean energy ETFs, QCLN, ICLN, and PBW. The focus will be exclusively on these ETFs and not single stocks.  Now is an excellent time to invest in clean energy, According to several sources,  renewables are set to represent ¾ of the $12T the world invests in new power technology through 2040. For the US alone almost $2 trillion is the investment needed to implement renewable energy targets by 2030.

NOTE:  It would be wise to keep a long-term investing mindset. Investments that focus on particular segments of the market can see significant short-term fluctuations in price. Additionally, in the past 10 years, clean energy ETFs have had returns that range from low single-digit gains to low single-digit declines.

Alrighty let's get into it.

# ICLN - iShares Global Clean Energy ETF :

Between the 3, ICLN currently has the most assets under management at $2.05B and the lowest expense ratio at 0.46%, however, it is also the least diversified, having only 30 current holdings.  This ETF tracks the S&P Global Clean Energy Index. ICLN holds a portfolio of 'clean energy' companies, such as biofuels, ethanol, geothermal, hydroelectric, solar and wind industries. Additionally it also holds companies that develop technology and equipment used in the process. It does not have exposure to the Electric Vehicle Market! Of these 3 it has the most Global Exposure.

Top 10 sectors (5 in this case since it doesn't even have 10):

* Renewable Energy Equipment & Services - **59.31%**
* Electric Utilities - **25.80%**
* Independent Power Producers - **9.28%**
* Multiline Utilities - **3.28%**
* Renewable Fuels - **2.32%**

Top 10 holdings:  SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. **7.50%,** Plug Power Inc. **7.21%,** Sunrun Inc. **7.16%,** Enphase Energy, Inc. **6.97%,** Xinyi Solar Holdings Ltd **6.24%,** First Solar, Inc **4.88%,** Vestas Wind Systems A/S **4.53%,** Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A. **4.50%,** Contact Energy Limited**3.48%,** Boralex Inc. Class A **3.42%. (NOTE** Total Top 10 Weighting - **55.89%)**

# QCLN - First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy ETF:

QCLN currently has $756 million assets under management with the middle expense ratio at 0.60%. Additionally, between these 3 ETFs, it is the second-most diversified with 43 current holdings. This ETF tracks the NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index, which, compared to the previous, includes a mix of U.S. and Canadian clean energy companies.  For this ETF companies are from the following four sub-sectors: advanced materials (that enable clean-energy/reduce need for oil products), energy intelligence (smart grid), energy storage and conversion (hybrid batteries), or renewable electricity generation (solar, wind, geothermal, etc).

Top 10 sectors:

* Renewable Energy Equipment & Services - **32.34%**
* Auto & Truck Manufacturers - **23.97%**
* Semiconductors - **13.18%**
* Electric Utilities - **7.40%**
* Electrical Components & Equipment - **6.97%**
* Commodity Chemicals - **5.97%**
* Independent Power Producers - **3.21%**
* Construction Supplies & Fixtures - **2.45%**
* Commercial REITs - **1.70%**
* Heavy Electrical Equipment - **0.84%**

Top 10 Holdings:  NIO Inc. Sponsored ADR Class A **10.00%,**  SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. **7.03%,** Enphase Energy, Inc. **6.53%,** Tesla Inc **5.94%,** Albemarle Corporation **5.06%,** ON Semiconductor Corporation **4.21%,** Brookfield Renewable Partners LP **4.08%,** Cree, Inc. **3.96%,** Universal Display Corporation **3.81%,** First Solar, Inc. **3.75%. (NOTE:** Total Top 10 Weighting - **54.37%)**

# PBW - Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF:

PBW currently has $962 million assets under management with the highest expense ratio of 0.70%, however it is also the most diversified with 48 current holdings. PBW is more diverse than just industry pure-plays like wind, solar, and biofuels, it aims to include companies based on their perceived relevance to the renewable energy space as well. Additionally, it follows a tiered, equal-weighting structure and caps any holding to a tax of 4%.

Top 10 sectors:

* Renewable Energy Equipment & Services - **44.46%**
* Auto & Truck Manufacturers - **13.70%**
* Semiconductors - **7.36%**
* Commodity Chemicals - **6.74%**

* Electric Utilities - **3.40%**
* Heavy Electrical Equipment - **3.17%**

Sponsored ADR Pfd Class B **2.49%.**

# Takeaway/Final Thoughts:

Clean energy has a very bright future but the industry is still emerging. For this reason, market risk and price volatility may be higher than the broader market, and ETFs may be more favorable compared to individual stocks.

**For those looking for a Clean Energy ETF that has more Global Exposure and is more diversified than ICLN, I would recommend checking out PBD - Invesco Global Clean Energy ETF.**

As always thankyou for reading. This is not all inclusive so please do your own research to supplement, and if anyone else has any other great Clean Energy ETFs that they may prefer please comment! Have a good day everyone!

Edit: Most sources would say to limit your cap your exposure to a market sector to 5%. This is, of course, up to personal preference, sector knowledge, and risk tolerance. 

Edit 2: One User reccomended CNRG, it is similar to PBW with slightly different weighting and more expose to Renewable Energy Equipment and Services. Definitely worth a closer look and consideration!

Edit 3: To the user that awarded the Platinum, you seriously made my night. I will drink a beer for you, thankyou!",2020-10-24 11:06:59
1463,For Those Who Don't Understand the Inevitable Short Squeeze with GME,1021,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/,475,"First, what is a short?

The first concept to understand is you **sell** to **open**, and **buy** to **close**.

Your brokerage will lend you x amount of shares and sell them on your behalf on the market. That you is **selling** to **open** the short position.

When you cover your position you **buy** to **close** the position.   
Let's say you short GME at $15.80 for 1000 shares and the price drops to $12. You would borrow 1000 shares from your broker that are sold on the market at $15.80, you decide to close your position at $12 where you would then buy those 1000 shares at $12/share and give them back to the broker. You would profit $3.80/share so $3800.

But what if the price goes up? Well, you have **cover** that position. So if you short GME at $15.80 and it goes up to $16.20 you are already in the hole $0.40/share. 

**Key Point:** Shorting happens on a **margin** account. That means, it's not actually your money either. It's the brokerages. If you are losing enough money you will go into what is called a **house call** which essentially will force you to cover your position. 

Moral of the story, if you drive the price up, you will force short positions to either cover or double down.   
The case of GME is extremely interesting because there is over 100% short interest, meaning there are more shorts than actual volume.

THIS is what causes a short squeeze. This is also why you can't expect it to happen over night.

Short Position A might be Bob from Kentucky who has a $350,000 margin account and he shorted at 15.80, once it gets to 16.50 we wants out because he's already losing so much and it's not worth the risk.

Short Position B might be Bank of A lot of Power who has a $4BN margin account and can wait years for it to fail, so they have no need to cover their positions unless it's looking really bad long term. (Like if this Cohen thing happens)

As shorts cover their positions, they are forced to buy at a higher price than they shorted, driving the stock price up. This will lead to more short positions covering driving the price up some more, leading to more short positions doing the same. All the way up to the whales who have massive short positions. 

GME has over 100% short interest, has formed a cup and handle, and the potential Cohen takeover is right around the corner. A squeeze will happen.

Hope this helps!

EDIT:

Regarding GME specifically. The earnings call on 12/8 has two possible outcomes.

1. Cohens letters are addressed and either GME begins moving forward and meets his demands or he gets a controlling position in the company.

2. Cohens letters are ignored.

If case 2 happens there are two possible outcomes.

1. Cohen initiates a hostile takeover
2. Cohen gives up the fight and sells his shares (this is the risk of this play, every other circumstance leads to a squeeze, this one leads to the shorts winning and GME heading for the toilet, however this is unlikely, it’s not like GME wants to go out of business, so it’s very unlikely Cohen and his public letters are ignored)",2020-12-04 09:49:55

Junk bonds are risky loans that private equity, hedge funds, and other shadow banking institutions give out to desperate companies that can't get loans from regular banks anymore. That's why junk bonds are shadow banking instead of traditional banking. JPow is using his unlimited printer to BAILOUT and give free money to the shadiest and greediest characters of wall street and society in general -  private equity, hedge fund managers, shady billionaires.

PE, hedgies, shady billionaires were screwed because the economy just halted and companies were going to default on these risky loans since they had no revenue coming in. This is who JPow is helping. He just bailed them all out by buying these risky junk bonds on the back of the American tax payer. You may become homeless and starve, but private equity, hedge fund managers, and shady billionaires will be made whole by the fed.

JPow's cover story for buying junk bonds is that he is helping corporations so they can keep American jobs intact. That is a total lie. Corporations will get all this free money and then lay off people anyway during the summer. All the free money will go to the wall street elite and billionaires.

Edit: Let me make it even simpler. Shadow banker (evil blood sucking parasite of wall street) gives money to company XYZ and company XYZ gives a high yield bond aka junk bond to the shadow banker. Company XYZ loses all revenue because of corona. Mr. shadow banker is now holding a worthless bond because XYZ went bankrupt and cannot pay the interest payments anymore. Mr. shadow banker very sad and maybe going broke too. Oh wait, here comes JPow with his unlimited money printer. JPow buys this bond from Mr. Shadow banker who gets saved from his risky loan and mr. shadow banker gets all his money back. The fed now owns this risky bond on the back of the American tax payer but this bond will likely be worthless since company XYZ can never pay back the loan. JPow saved the shadow banker, question is will JPow save you when you are homeless and starving?

Edit: Some people saying, you just don't understand this stuff. It's too complicated. Don't worry the billionaires know what they are doing. Well you know what, if its that complicated and confusing it probably shouldn't be happening. Wall Street loves to create complicated tricky instruments so they can steal all the money from the average American.",2020-04-10 16:00:12

Stocks fell after the sell-off accelerated in the last hour of the market, as market participants closely monitored development for a near-term stimulus package and rising coronavirus cases in Europe and the US. 

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 1.63% down. The S&P 500 (SPY) finished the day 1.49% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) ended the day 1.34% down. Stocks finished deep in the red after the last hour sell-off.

Over the weekend, there were several developments regarding a coronavirus-relief package. In comments to reporters in Nevada, Pres. Trump said “I want to do a bigger number than she wants \[Pelosi’s $2.2 trillion proposal\]. That doesn’t mean all Republicans agree with me, but I think they will in the end. If she would go along, I think they would too, on stimulus.” These comments imply that Pres. Trump is willing to propose a higher number than the $1.8 trillion the White House proposed recently. While Republicans have consistently balked at such a high price-tag, maybe Pres. Trump’s endorsement can help move the needle.

In response, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi set a Tuesday deadline for reaching an agreement with the Trump administration to pass stimulus before the November election. She and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, another key negotiator, reportedly continued to have discussions over the weekend and are scheduled to meet again today. Drew Hamill, Pelosi’s spokesperson said, “While there was some encouraging news on testing, there remains work to do to ensure there is a comprehensive testing plan that includes contact tracing and other measures to address the impact on the virus on different communities.”

According to data from John Hopkins, there were 57,000 and 48,000 new cases recorded on Saturday. While this is a marked improvement from 69,000 cases on Friday (the highest one day total since late-July) the numbers appear to be stagnating around the 50,000 new cases per day. The South and the Midwest have been the most hard-hit regions.

In Europe, there has been a surge in cases, with health and government officials warning of a second wave and imposing new restrictions throughout the continent. The Republic of Ireland will move into ""Level Five"" restrictions from midnight on Wednesday, the country's highest COVID alert level, for the next six weeks. Switzerland and Italy are imposing a nationwide mask mandate in all public spaces, even outdoors from Monday. In England a three-tier system remains in place, with varying restrictions imposed depending on whether an area is on ""medium,"" ""high"" or ""very high"" alert. London is an area of “high alert” meaning members of different households cannot meet in indoor spaces and restaurants, bars have a 10 p.m. curfew, and a ban on gatherings of more than six people. In France, nine cities, including Paris, have been placed under a 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew.

Edit 3: I went ahead and bouts some F, UNM and CTL but honestly I’m not seeing much out there. Everything is priced either fairly or overpriced and I’m not seeing any deals. I think we are at the top of this market. 


Edit 2 : Since the MACD is about to cross over and RSI is so high I’m going to wait a few days before investing. FYI. But typically these value buys are good buys even at the top of a market.  


Edit 1: someone was asking what this means

This sorts all companies in the s&amp;amp;amp;p500 by a value function. The function uses quarterly earnings growth, price to book ratio, peg ratio, 52 week change. The list is sorted by each metric and each company is assigned a value. For example the company with the lowest price to book gets 1 point. The company with the second lowest price to book ratio gets 2 points. And so forth. After all the metrics are added up there’s a total value and the entire list is sorted by that total value. Ford has a total value of 236 which means it’s the best of all the metrics combined. and if you look at the numbers you can see why. Last quarter’s EPS went up 600%. 

It’s then up to you to examine the company and decide if you want to buy. Looking at Ford it’s revenue went down 50% and it’s EPS was already low so it didn’t take much for it to rise 600%. Net income and cash on hand went up so they must have laid off lot of people. 

You do this for every stock etc. this is just to give you a list of companies that stand out for you to pay attention to and possibly invest in. Based on this I would say Ford will survive and it’s a good buy at these prices. But you have to make your own mind up. That lost revenue looks terrible.

Nearly every company has reported Q2 earnings. 



I was very surprised to see Ford (F) at the top of the list. UNM looks attractive although I wish I would have got in at $17. 

HIG also looks attractive. There's a lot of stocks that look attractive that didn't show up last time I posted because I only included companies that had reported earnings. Now that most have reported earnings I can feel more confident making these value purchases.

1473,A discussion about “time in the market vs timing the market”,1004,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k7cq51/a_discussion_about_time_in_the_market_vs_timing/,214,"We’ve all seen it parroted on every investing related thread in the history of Reddit- “time in the market beats timing the market”. But I feel like this phrase gets misused quite a lot, and I would like to take this boring workday of a Saturday to just show the power of what “time in the market” actually has. 

1. What “time in the market” means and what it doesn’t mean 

Time in the market means, basically, maintaining ownership of assets that either 1, typically appreciate in value over time (stocks, real estate, commodities, etc) or 2, that produce a steady, ideally increasing, stream of income (dividend paying stocks, a business, rental properties, debt, etc). By “time in the market” it means that ownership of these assets over long periods of time, as in years and decades, is the key to wealth accumulation. If you look at most wealthy person alive today and in history, they gained their wealth through assets. They accumulate assets and own them. 

“Time in the market” does NOT mean buying clearly overvalued hype stocks because “I’m in for the long term”. I’m not gonna say any because I don’t want the comments to just be arguing about whether or not tesla is overvalued, but I hope you get the idea. However this doesn’t mean to just let your cash sit on the sidelines “waiting for a crash”. Typically there is no reason to have all your net worth tied up in cash, as it is the only asset class guaranteed to lose value over time. 

Rather, you should be in the middle: continuing to own assets you already own and being on the lookout for more, fairly valued ones. I promise you that you can find value out there if you look for it. Even then you don’t necessarily always have to be buying. Sometimes doing nothing is the best choice. 

2. You’re probably wasting your time (and money) 

If you’re anticipating a crash, good luck. There have been 8 major crashes since the 1920’s: an average of one every 12 years. There have been flash crashes and small recession but these shouldn’t concern you at all. On the large scale, the market has trended up for most of its existence. What makes this time different, exactly? Bulls have a tendency to believe that this time is different, but bears can have the same mindset, especially  considering that the US has been in a bull market for most of its history. So what makes this time different? 

Sure, we will enter a bear market eventually but the US market has never failed retest its highs. If you’re selling because you anticipate a “correction”, you’re just wasting your time and money. Corrections are a blip on the radar over time. They are normal, healthy and should be seen as a good thing, just the market breathing, per se; nobody actually thinks “stocks only go up and never go down”. 

Once you gain real money, in the high six figures and up, taxes will really start to eat into you. Selling positions with the intent to buy back in after a correction is probably an unprofitable endeavor. Why pay a good chunk of your earnings in taxes just to buy back 10% cheaper, especially when the 10% drop may or may not happen when you expect it to? This ties in to the last paragraph of point one, sometimes it’s best to do nothing and just continue to hold, letting your money work for you. 

3. Generational wealth

This is my main point. The Rothschilds, for example, have been building an empire for almost 300 years. That is 300 years of compounding interest. One thing they have done is accumulate assets, not sell them. The wealthy families of the Netherlands have been passing down assets for almost 400 years. 

Even on a less grandiose scale, just look to this subreddit. You’ll notice a lot of the users with higher portfolio balances probably received a nice inheritance somewhere along the way. This isn’t a bad thing and shouldn’t be shamed. After all, isn’t that everyone’s goal, to pass their wealth into their children? Unfortunately, with inheritances, a huge majority of inherited wealth is lost by the third generation. When the younger generation doesn’t know how to properly manage wealth, they end up wasting it all instead of further building it up. 

4. Compound interest 

Some call it the eighth wonder of the world, and rightfully so. There is no reason to interrupt compound interest unnecessarily. I would hope that most people here are investing with the goal of attaining compound interest, and selling your compounding assets is a solid way to halt it. 

5. Dividends 

Whether or not you chase dividends, I think we can all agree that we get some form of dividends or income from our investments. Dividends really show their power after several years of ownership. Buffett, for example, gets a 40% annual return from dividends on his initial Coca Cola investment. Fourty percent! And he doesn’t even DRIP them. Why on earth would people get rid of their assets that have potential to give those kind of returns after some years of ownership is beyond me. If you do a dividend return calculator going back multiple decades, you’ll find that most dividend paying securities will have similar returns once you have mature ownership of them. 

6. On “timing the market”

This is probably a controversial one but I definitely don’t believe in just buying whatever tickers you want because “time in the market beats timing the market”. Like I said above, time in > timing because of generational wealth, compound interest and ownership. It doesn’t mean buying the hottest Reddit ticker because you’re in for the long term. Taking well assessed risks with positive and realistic upside is ideal. 

Spending time to make sure the investment you’re about to make is a good investment is smart. If spending a week or two assessing your decision is a way to “miss out on sick gains bro, it’ll go up another 50% before you buy”, it’s probably a FOMO stock and you shouldn’t be in in the first place. If patience is key, that means patience with buying is just as important as patience with holding. 

At the end of the day I’m a believer in ownership. Looking through most of wealthy individuals of today and in history, they all had one thing in common: they maintained possession of assets. They don’t sell their portfolios because they’re scared of a crash, they don’t have their net worth in a savings account. They assume a little bit of managed risk and let their money work for them.

Going ""long"" on a stock means that if the price goes up, your profits go up.

When you buy a share, you create a sort of contract with a stock exchange that is then stored on their internal, proprietary database: their ledger.

The plain-English contract between you and the exchange is: ""Hey, I'm Bobby Ronson, and I own one share of $FOO, purchased at $100. I have the right to sell it to a buyer at any point in the future, at a price determined by the market."" The contract is executed instantly. It's kind of like a game:

&#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/Gowsqzv.png](https://i.imgur.com/Gowsqzv.png)

&#x200B;

Long means ""up is good; down is bad"".

&#x200B;

**Shorting a stock**

Shorting a stock is the opposite going long; if the price goes down when you're short on a stock, your profits go up.

Here's how shorting works¹: Given a share price of $100 that you expect to drop, you can borrow $100 from a broker and promise to pay it back in the form of one share. If the price drops, you can buy a share using this borrowed money and give it to the broker. You gain the difference.

¹: Technically, it's a bit more complicated. The above simplification is a heuristic I use because it's conceptually accurate. To quote @DivergentViewUS:

>When you short, you borrow the stock, not the cash. Let's say you short 100 shares of DIS, the broker lets you borrow 100 shares from someone else's account, the broker then sells the other person's 100 shares of DIS, and then, gives you the cash which goes into your account. You then are on the hook to re-purchase 100 shares of DIS at some point in the future (called covering your short). If DIS goes down, then, you repurchase at a lower price and therefore make money.

When you're short and price increases, you either wait for it to come back down, or you eat the losses and buy a share at the higher price using the borrowed money plus some of your own money before giving it back to the broker. You'd lose the difference.

The plain-English contract between you and the exchange is: ""Hey, I'm Bobby Ronson, and I have borrowed $100 from you with the promise of paying you back in the form of one $FOO share, currently valued at $100. I am on the hook to eventually get my hands on a share for you at any point in the future. If the price of one $FOO share increases to $120, I will have to use the money that I borrowed from you to buy a portion of that share, and then $20 of my own money to buy the rest of the share. I will then give you the share at a personal loss of 20%. If the price of one $FOO share decreases to $80, I will be able to use the money that I borrowed from you to buy an entire share, and then keep the extra $20 for myself."" This game is similar to the first, but flipped:

&#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/vkAENZX.png](https://i.imgur.com/vkAENZX.png)

&#x200B;

Short means ""up is bad; down is good"".  Each of these instruments allow you to engage with the market through a contract that records the following:

&#x200B;

>`Contract Type: Purchase Stock`  
>  
>`----------------------------`  
>  
>`Wallet ID: Bobby Ronson`  
>  
>`Ticker symbol: $FOO`  
>  
>`Price at time of contract creation: $100`  
>  
>`Price at time of contract execution: $100`  
>  
>`Number of shares: 1`  
>  
>`Buying or selling: Buying`  
>  
>`Date contract signed: Just now`  
>  
>`Date contract executed: Just now (manual execution)`

&#x200B;

This ""smart contract"" lets us bet on the direction of a stock's price. Note that ""selling"" without a share to sell is ""shorting"".

&#x200B;

\---

**Limit/Stop Orders**

The Price at time of time of contract execution doesn't have to be the current price, though. If you $FOO is currently priced at $100 and you want to go long when it hits $120 because you anticipate an upward breakout at that price, you can place a ""buy stop order"". If you want to go short when $FOO hits $120 because you anticipate a downward correction, you can place a ""sell stop order"". Even if the price of $FOO is $100, you can purchase the following contract:

&#x200B;

>`Contract Type: Buy Stop Order`  
>  
>`----------------------------`  
>  
>`Wallet ID: Bobby Ronson`  
>  
>`Ticker symbol: $FOO`  
>  
>`Price at time of contract creation: $100`  
>  
>`Price at time of contract execution: $120 [New!]`  
>  
>`Number of shares: 1`  
>  
>`Buying or selling: Buying`  
>  
>`Date contract signed: Just now`  
>  
>`Date contract executed: TBD (price action) [New!]`

&#x200B;

This contract, in contrast to the first, will only execute if and when the price equals $120. It's a more nuanced game, but not all that different from the two we've seen so far:

&#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/8oABtgj.png](https://i.imgur.com/8oABtgj.png)

&#x200B;

Once the share price trips the wire of your limit, the contract is executed just like the very first game we played.

A notable comment from @DivergentViewUS:

>As an FYI, I've never seen anyone use this type of order among professional investors….just not the way people think. Most analysts/PMs at institutions are not buying based on momentum. This type of order might be used more by programmatic/algorithmic funds.

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

**Options**

An option is a slightly more complex instrument.

The simple rule is that if a share price moves away from a specific value by a specific time, you profit.

&#x200B;

**Going long with a call option**

Given a share price of $100 that you expect to climb beyond $120 by November 5th, you may purchase the option to ""purchase a share - or call it into your wallet - for $120 at any point between now and November 5th"". If the price increases from $100 to $200 sometime between now and November 5th, you can exercise your option for an $80 profit. If the price never hits $120, and instead falls to a November 5th price of $40, you aren't obligated to do anything; you can opt to eat the cost of the option. Here's what the option game looks like:

&#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/SOXPdlG.png](https://i.imgur.com/SOXPdlG.png)

&#x200B;

**Going short with a put option**

Given a share price of $100 that you expect to climb no higher than $120 by November 5th, you may buy the option to ""sell a share (or put it out of your wallet) for $120 at any point between now and November 5th"". If the price falls to a November 5th price of $40, you can then exercise your option for an $80 profit. If the price rockets up to $200, you're under no obligations and only have to eat the relatively small cost of the option.

Note that if the price never hits break-even, you're responsible for your loss of principal; it's not like there's no downside.

&#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/6klYYGN.png](https://i.imgur.com/6klYYGN.png)

&#x200B;

\---

Options and stocks are two different types of financial instruments that are traded in two different markets. The price that you pay for an option is determined by supply and demand, in the same way that the price of a share is determined by supply and demand. The supply and demand for an option is derived from the supply and demand of the underlying shares. This is why options are referred to as derivative instruments.

Here's what an option contract looks like:

&#x200B;

>`Contract Type: Buy Call Option`  
>  
>`----------------------------`  
>  
>`Wallet ID: Bobby Ronson`  
>  
>`Ticker symbol: $FOO`  
>  
>`Price at time of contract creation: $100`  
>  
>`Price at time of contract execution: $120 [""strike price""]`  
>  
>`Number of shares: 100 [1 contract = 100 shares]`  
>  
>`Buying or selling: ""Buying"" [Buying a call option = long]`  
>  
>`Date contract signed: Just now`  
>  
>`Date contract executed: TBD [See Note]`  
>  
>`Date contract expires: November 5th [New!]`  
>  
>`Option price: $200 [New!]`

&#x200B;

Note: Once you hold an option, you can do three things with it: You can manually exercise it at any time before the expiry; it can automatically be exercised by the broker at expiry; you can sell the contract back into the market.

This ""smart contract"" lets us bet on price and time in a way that limits our losses and leverages our capital.

&#x200B;

Let's look at an example using a real stock: Tesla.

Let's suppose that I have $10,000 that I would like to invest in Tesla, and that I'm so confident in Tesla that I'm willing to throw it all away on a highly leveraged, optimistic bet. $TSLA is currently trading at $221. I expect it to be far above $221 by Q4 2019. Here are my games:

&#x200B;

**Game 1: Going long with stocks**

* I can buy 10,000 / 221 = \~45 shares
* My ""break even"" is at a share price of just over $221 since the ""price to play"" is simply the $5 trade commission that my broker charges me.
* Worst case is the stock tanks overnight and I lose $10,000.
* Ideal case is the stock climbs to $400 and I earn (400–221) \* 45 or \~$8,000 (or potentially much more - stocks have no time limits)
* My max loss is $10,000, or 100% of my investment; my potential gain is \~80%.

&#x200B;

**Game 2: Going long with options**

It looks like the $225 December strike price will cost about $35 per share:

&#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/06NgPMX.png](https://i.imgur.com/06NgPMX.png)

&#x200B;

* I have the market power equivalent of 10,000 / 35 = \~285 shares, or just under 3 contracts. (partial contracts are not allowed, but for this example, let's suppose they are)
* My ""break even"" is at a share price of 221 + $35 option price = \~$256. If the price breaks $256 between now and December, I'm golden.
* Worst case is the stock tanks overnight and I lose the $10,000 option contract.
* Ideal case is the stock climbs to $400 by December and I earn (400–225) \* 285 or \~$50,000
* My max loss is $10,000–100% of my investment; my potential gain is \~500%.

&#x200B;

Options magnify my potential reward while also magnifying the potential for losses; Tesla dipping 20% means I lose 100% of my principal.

&#x200B;

Here's my ""contract"", in this case:

&#x200B;

>`Contract Type: Buy Call Option`  
>  
>`----------------------------`  
>  
>`Wallet ID: Bobby Ronson`  
>  
>`Ticker symbol: $TSLA`  
>  
>`Price at time of contract creation: $221`  
>  
>`Price at time of contract execution: $225 [""strike price""]`  
>  
>`Number of shares: 285`  
>  
>`Buying or selling: ""Buying"" [Buying a call option = long]`  
>  
>`Date contract signed: Just now`  
>  
>`Date contract executed: TBD`  
>  
>`Date contract expires: December 20th`  
>  
>`Option price: $10,000`

1485,Farmers Are Buying Up Old Tractors Because New Ones Are Pointlessly Complicated and Expensive | Is John Deere alienating customers by pricing themselves out of the market?,966,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/eqxroz/farmers_are_buying_up_old_tractors_because_new/,64,"https://www.thedrive.com/news/31761/enormous-costs-of-new-tractors-drive-demand-of-40-year-old-equipment-to-all-time-highs?xid=fbshare

In this piece by *The Drive*, the author proposes a scenario in which John Deere slowly loses its customer base by creating a technologically advanced product, raising prices to the point that older loyal customers are turning to secondary used markets to fulfill their equipment to needs. 

Agriculture has long been an industry participated in by few, but contributes the sustenance of many. Ag has high upside when producers can maximize efficiency, find production equilibrium with supply needs through economies of scale (which allows for fewer producers to need to play and those producers increase the size of their enterprise). But in order to really make economies of scale advantageous, it requires mechanized help. 

John Deere tractors are your flagship tractor. When you think of tractors, the green with yellow accented behemoths tilling those fields are probably the first that come to mind. But what happens when farmers begin to look at secondary markets to satiate their equipment needs when the producer of their prized equipment no longer is working with their customers to meet their needs? 

[Newer models can run upwards of $300,000 for a rig](https://www.fastline.com/farm-equipment-for-sale/listings/john-deere-tractors/results?category=Tractors&manufacturer=John+Deere&minprice=220000&page=1) even on the used market. Why pay $200,000+ for a machine that you could buy for $30,000 thats 40 years old? In fact, farmers are turning to these older machines because they are less complicated to fix. But the demand for those older models are actually driving up the prices in the secondary markets because sellers realize how valuable their old machines are becoming. 

John Deere tractors are becoming more technologically advanced, but this may not be a good thing. Deere is raising the prices of their machines, and making it such that farmers are looking to used markets to find older machines. If you’ve ever worked on an old car, you can think of it in the same manner—the older tractors are very barebones and mainly mechanical. If you understand how to repair the machine, it’s a fairly straightforward process. 

Not only is the upfront cost a factor when it comes to investing in one of these machines, but maintenance repairs is a contributing factor. These newer machines have technological locks built into the operating systems that limit private owners from performing their own repairs on the machine, forcing them to contact the dealership, have them send out a mechanic representative at the dealerships convenience, potentially holding up production for extended periods of time. This puts the farmer’s operations at a reduced level unnecessarily, and at a greater cost, than what they normally would repair themselves.

Due to this, farmers have found an outside solution to this roadblock Deere corporate has put in place to lock the technology systems of the machines: [Ukrainian software hacks.](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xykkkd/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware). [October of 2016, buyers were required to sign a licensing agreement forbidding the repair and modification of farming equipment.](https://www.deere.com/privacy_and_data/docs/agreement_pdfs/english/2016-10-28-Embedded-Software-EULA.pdf)

Is John Deere alienating one of its leading sales segments? With international trade agreements being formed, amended and expanded—soybean, grain and corn is going to be in great demand. Farmers are going to need equipment that fulfills their operations, small or large scale. These new equipment prices, in addition to prices to maintain the machines, are going to be passed onto consumers, ultimately driving up prices for some of our most common goods. Why pay more than you have to for a machine today when one three decades old can be refurbished and folded into operation for significantly less cost? 

According to their financial statements, FY 2019 revenue was the first year since FY 2014 that it was greater. Bringing in $39.26B in 2019, 8.9% greater than the second highest year this decade in FY 2014 at $36.02B. $DE’s brought in a net profit of $3.25B in FY 2019, up 2.8% from FY 2014. FY 2015-2018 all showed negative growth from the peak in 2014 if omitting 2019 data. 

With John Deere and Caterpillar ($CAT) being some of the leading manufacturing segments in the United States, is manufacturing at risk if $DE doesn’t change their business model to be more accommodating to their customers? $DE and $CAT are both major construction equipment manufacturers, with Caterpillar leading over Deere in that segment.

From John Deere’s financial statements, they revenued $20,511B in Ag sales (84% of total sales), compared to construction at $3,831B (16% of their equipment sales). So clearly, their ag customers will have significant leverage if a portion of them begin to look in the secondary markets for used equipment they can fix themselves, or even if they purchase new equipment, but use this Ukrainian hack to crack the operating systems of their machines and fix it themselves. 

With agriculture being Deere’s most prominent segment, if they don’t begin to accommodate their farmer customers more carefully, $DE could begin to face sales pressures in the next coming years. The commodities will be needed to be farmed with or without Deere, so will they bend the knee? Or continue in an adverse customer-producer relationship that ultimately may hurt the company. If Deere doesn’t change their business model, they may eventually price themselves out of the market.

TL; DR: if John Deere doesn’t start making efforts to work with the customers as opposed to trying to squeeze every penny out of them, it could spell trouble.",2020-01-20 02:41:52

The markets were expecting 3 million jobless, but got over 6.6 million jobless just from last week. This is on top of the 3.3 million the week before. These are enormous numbers and I know we were expecting this and the Government is covering unemployment. But the question is: How many of these jobs will come back? – My worry is a lot of them will Not.
Before the economic data came in global markets had a positive move. In Asia, most markets were in the green, with South Korea leading the way, up 2.35%. Chinese indexes were up around 2%, while Japan was the only major market in the red, down -1.35%.
European markets are trading right now with slight gains. German, British and French stocks started in the green, declined twice to neutral and right now (8 30AM ET) are trading up around 0.5%.
US futures have been green all night, raising more than 2% when Europe opened. But as the US is waking up, we have seen declines and right now they are hovering around 1.5% up.
The outbreak is still spreading with total new cases still raising. We will probably hit 1000000 cases worldwide today. But good news is coming from the hardest hit places, with Italy and New York reporting less new cases than previous days. At the same time there are spikes in cases all around the USA and this could pose difficulties in fighting the spread.

Oil is in the news, up 11% after remarks from President Trump that Russia and Saudi Arabia are talking to reach deal. I have been talking about oil in the past two days and I am very glad about this move, since it was very much expected. Even at 22.20, it is a good buy, since there is constant upward movement. Even if it goes up another 10%, it will still be at 25$, which is not sustainable for most US manufacturers. The top oil executives are headed to the White House tomorrow and all of this movement is due to expectations that the Government will either help the industry or pressure Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut production. Whatever the case, a great way to make big gains.
Last Thursday when we got the 3 million number the stock market shoot up and had one of the best days in this crises. This was a very unusual and mislead rally that lead to significant declines in the next two trading days.
My advice is do not enter at the open, let the market stabilize and access the new numbers and if you see stocks erasing the pre-market gains that is the mark to sell and get in for a 0.5-1% profit. Have tight ranges, small stop losses and take profits, do not get greedy it is still very volatile.

I've created a semi-automated spreadsheet that pulls information from google finance and gives me an overview over my current portfolio. It also converts my portfolio into a graphic and is updated automatically when reloading. All you have to do is type in the symbol and the amount and it works.

It then calculates if I made money or lost money and how big the stake of each position is compared to others. Really helpful.

**HOW TO USE**

1. Make a copy and save it to your own drive so you can edit it. have fun with it.
2. Choose Currency (on bottom of the sheet). You can delete all other sheets.
3. Type the symbols and values into the fields I marked blue. Stock prices have to be negative! (E.g. if you paid USD2000 for 10 $FB stocks you need to type in -2000)
4. All non blue fields are either optional or will be calculated automatically
5. Delete all other rows you dont need

**UNUSUAL STOCKS, ETFS or MARKETS**

Sometimes google doesn't recognize the symbol. Especially if it is a Non-American stock, or ETF. Then you have to also type in the market. So what you do to make it work is put =googlefinance(<yourmarketcode>:<sharesymbol>) inside current price row. you can find an example at the Daimler row way down in the sheet.

I have no financial position in Tesla at this point in time and no interest in initiating one within the next month.

&#x200B;

# Introduction

There seems to be a strong sentiment among some that Tesla is vastly overvalued, and that the current stock price is completely unrooted in reality. I understand the viewpoint, but don't really share the belief. That's not particularly surprising as I consider myself a Tesla optimist. I decided to present in brief the case for Tesla's valuation as I understand it.

&#x200B;

# Overvalued?

Tesla's current market capitalisation appears to be grossly overvalued, especially when compared to their peers in the automotive sector as [these charts so clearly illustrate](https://preview.redd.it/gdvz8sgmpz061.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=45524ed08b3899febc3fa9b67329569e25a906b9).

In fact, the charts actually understate things as Tesla's market cap currently seats at around $464 billion. You could add another Daimler to the US and EU listed companies and they would still have a lower market capitalisation than Tesla.

This really is the case for Tesla being overvalued: it's automotive revenues is many times it's current market capitalisation. [Per MarketWatch, Tesla's trailing PE is 978.44](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla/company-profile?mod=mw_quote_tab), so it's not as if Tesla is especially profitable either.

On a fundamentals basis, Tesla appears to be grossly overvalued.

&#x200B;

# Growth

The above chart doesn't necessarily indicate that Tesla's current market capitalisation is an extremely speculative bubble that could burst soon, but more that Tesla is not valued based on its current financial situation. Tesla is valued as an extreme growth company, and it's growth over the past five years bears this out.

**Revenue**

|Year|Revenue (USD millions)|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2008|15|\-|
|2009|112|646.67|
|2010|117|4.46|
|2011|204|74.36%|
|2012|413|102.45|
|2013|2,013|387.41|
|2014|3,198|58.87|
|2015|4,046|26.52|
|2016|7,000|73.01|
|2017|11,759|67.99|
|2018|21,461|82.51|
|2019|24,578|14.52|

[Source (Macro Trends)](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenue)

&#x200B;

To contextualise this, here's Tesla's trailing CAGR:

|Time span|CAGR (%)|
|:-|:-|
|5 years|50.36%|
|7 years|79.27%|
|10 years|71.45%|

Over the last decade, Tesla has demonstrated formidable growth. There's reason to believe that they can continue to show impressive growth (albeit lowered going forward).

The first two quarters of 2020 were battered by a pandemic (Tesla factories faced lockdowns due to the pandemic), and as a result are somewhat of an exception. There were no lockdowns during Q3.

Looking at Tesla's Q3 results, we see that the formidable growth story continues;

||Q3 2019|Q3 2020|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Vehicle Deliveries|97,186|139,593|44|
|Automotive Revenues (USD millions)|5,353|7,611|42|
|Storage Deployed (MW)|477|759|59|
|Solar Deployed|43|57|33|
|Energy Revenue|402|579|44|
|Total Revenue (USD millions)|6,303|8,771|39|

&#x200B;

**Going Forward**

Wall Street seems to expect the growth story to continue. Per Market Insider, here are the consensus analyst estimates for the next five years:

|Year|Revenue (USD Millions)|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020|30,626|24.61|
|2021|44,937|46.73|
|2022|55,963|24.54|
|2023|79,620|42.27|
|2024|102,526|28.77|

[Source (Markets Insider)](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock)

&#x200B;

I personally think that analyst consensus estimates are significantly underestimating Tesla's growth. In particular their figures for 2020 seem off by $2 billion or more. Analyst estimates for Q3 2020 were off by $495 million, and the estimate of $9,884M for Q4 seems off by around $1,500M (assuming Tesla meets the 180K delivery target) without accounting for the recognition of any deferred revenue. Tesla had $1,258M in deferred revenue at the end of Q3.

This may seem optimistic, but you're welcome to hold me to do this on January 28th 2021.

Despite their (potential) underestimation of Tesla, analysts expect a 5 year CAGR in 2024 of 33%. Tesla is expected to continue to show formidable growth to the end of the decade.

&#x200B;

**Expansion**

Tesla would execute on this formidable growth story through capital expenditure. They will build numerous service centres and gigafactories. The goal is to have giga factories on all 6 economic continents (with some continents having several factories) in order to lower the expenses involved in distributing the cars and to streamline logistics. Currently, Tesla is building two new gigafactories in Berlin and Austin and is currently expanding Giga Shanghai.

An inherent assumption is that the market has the demand to absorb all this extra supply. M[any states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/jpi7br8rpz061.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6524f0cf77a69a52009011eff2160b34c2c1d8e).

[Source (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles#Countries_and_large_jurisdictions)

&#x200B;

Around 13 states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles on or before 2030. Over the coming decade, [the EV total addressable market is projected to grow to 27 million by 2030](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/electric-vehicle-market-209371461.html#:~:text=The%20Electric%20Vehicles%20Market%20is,is%20from%202019%20to%202030) (at a CAGR of 21%). This again seems a bit too conservative. [EV sales were down in the first half of 2020 (due to the pandemic), but in July sales grew 77% YoY](https://www.ev-volumes.com/). Some states have also pulled forward their timelines for phasing out fossil fuels since the forecast was initially made.

Tesla would face stiff competition going forward, but the total addressable market would grow fast enough to absorb all of Tesla's growth in supply if they can successfully market their vehicles. The risk here is that Tesla would fail to execute not that the total addressable market isn't large enough.

As an optimist, I'm fine betting on Tesla's ability to execute.

&#x200B;

**Access to Capital**

To fund the massive expansion expected of them, Tesla would need to spend a lot on capital expenditure. Fortunately, access to capital is not a problem for Tesla.

* Tesla's cash on hand at the end of Q3 2020 was $14.5 billion.
   * Per [their 10Q filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data//1318605/000156459020047486/tsla-10q_20200930.htm) this is already sufficient to fund their capex needs up to 2023.
* Free cash flow for the quarter was $1,395M.
* Giving their current market capitalisation ($464 billion) and the mandatory demand from index funds on their inclusion ($60 billion), Tesla has an opportunity to raise $10 - $20 billion in a new capital raise.
   * A $20 billion raise would give them enough cash on hand at the end of 2020 to finance their expansion plans for several years going forward.
* Free cash flow is expected to rise going forward:
   * In Q3 there was a 234% increase QoQ and a 276% increase YoY.
   * Tesla has been seeing increased efficiency of capital expenditures.

&#x200B;

# Margins

Another component of the Tesla bull case is that in addition to hyper growth in revenues, Tesla's profit margins would also rise significantly over the next decade. [This is readily apparent if we look at Tesla's past four quarters](https://preview.redd.it/qygtw9twpz061.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f6950e6e813a92b1743b89fc56ab8247129fd8d).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/4E7BR9_TSLA_Q3_2020_Update_P0Q85U.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2020-Update.pdf%22)

&#x200B;

Automotive gross margins have steadily risen from 22.8% a year ago to 25.4% last quarter and seem set to continue their upwards trajectory. Total gross margins have risen from 18.9% to 23.5%. There are good reasons to expect the rise to continue and maybe even accelerate going forward:

* Manufacturing Efficiencies
* Network Services

&#x200B;

**Manufacturing Efficiencies**

As Tesla continues to ramp up production and innovate, they will be able to drive down the manufacturing cost of their vehicles, benefit even further from economies of scale (both in their production and their supply lines as EV demand heats up globally). Tesla's capital expenditure will become even more efficient; they will be able to squeeze out more manufacturing capacity, from the same amount of capital expenditures.

[Tesla's rise in capex efficiency is apparent when you compare their capex expenditure in 2020 (construction of Giga Berlin, Giga Texas, Fremont Model Y ramp, and expansion of Giga Shanghai) to capex expenditure in 2017 (Fremont Model 3 ramp)](https://preview.redd.it/7r2b1vd0qz061.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=2688cee4dc6abdb063a5ee431dc0193792aedc2b).

[Source (Statista)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/715421/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-production/)

&#x200B;

In addition to the aforementioned favourable trends, there are concrete reasons to expect Tesla to perform very well on the capex efficiency front over the next decade. A[t Tesla's battery day, Tesla laid out a roadmap to drastic increases in efficiency](https://preview.redd.it/uujqxx1jqz061.png?width=1942&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea32aa9410a4110984fcce8c32a401b260d63124).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-share.thron.com/content/?id=96ea71cf-8fda-4648-a62c-753af436c3b6&pkey=S1dbei4)

&#x200B;

Tesla is forecasting a **69%!!!** increase in capex efficiency in the coming years.

Furthermore, the cost of batteries is forecast to fall by as much as **56%**. Batteries are a significant component of the total cost, and the reduction in the cost of batteries would further improve Tesla's margins.

Aside from batteries, and capex efficiency, Tesla should also be able to drive down the cost of manufacturing other components of their electric cars due to [Wright's Law](https://ark-invest.com/wrights-law/).

While Tesla would pass on some of these cost savings to the consumer, they wouldn't pass on all of them. This is evidenced by Tesla's improved margins in 2020 despite several price cuts.

&#x200B;

**Network Services**

Tesla's network services are included with their automotive revenues, but represent a novel high margin business that isn't part of the traditional automotive playbook. Using Tesla's fleet as the platform, Tesla can sell software products, subscriptions and other services to their customers. The recurring revenue of subscriptions in particular is a cause for optimism (especially given the potential high margins).

Tesla's existing products:

* Software
   * Full Self Driving: $10,000
   * Enhanced Autopilot: $4,000
      * This isn't currently available was previously an option
   * Acceleration Boosts
      * Model 3: $2,000
      * Model Y: $2,000
* Subscriptions
   * Premium Connectivity: $10/month
   * Full Self Driving: ???
      * Reportedly coming soon
* Miscellaneous
   * Supercharging

Tesla has only a few such products now, but they would likely develop more such products in time. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas referred to this as ""the internet of cars"".

&#x200B;

# Beyond Traditional Automotive Revenues

It's a common statement among Tesla bulls that Tesla is not just an automaker. In my experience sceptics tend to be annoyed by this and (rightly) point out that the supermajority of Tesla's revenue comes from traditional automotive endeavours (selling their cars). While this is true now, it's not necessarily the case 10 years from now, and there's reason to believe that traditional automotive activities may no longer constitute a majority of Tesla's revenue, and may represent an even smaller portion of Tesla's profits.

I'll cover some other businesses of Tesla's that are poised to grow over the next 10 years:

* The aforementioned Network Services
* Energy
* Ridesharing
* Insurance

&#x200B;

**Energy**

Tesla's energy business is poised to benefit substantially from the shift towards renewable power sources. In particular, Tesla's battery storage businesses stands a lot to gain. [Per the Financial Times, total energy storage capacity would grow rapidly over the coming decade to over 700 Gwh by 2030](https://preview.redd.it/wn3yw4g0wz061.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fb25a8c625ab3d725f2895aad4662de4271c6b9).

[Source (Financial Times)](https://www.ft.com/content/7c07e492-41eb-4488-bc34-77b9d806ed5c?shareType=nongift)

&#x200B;

The total addressable market is once again large enough to soak up hyper growth from Tesla over the next decade. Musk himself has stated that he expects Tesla's energy business to be as large as their automotive business long term (a reminder that Tesla's targeted end state is 20 million cars per year).

A refresher on Tesla Energy's available products:

* Solar
   * Tesla solar panels: $1.49/watt (after incentives)
   * Solar Roof
* Battery Storage
   * Power Wall (residential)
   * Power Pack (commercial)
   * Mega Pack (utility scale)

&#x200B;

**Ridesharing**

If Tesla can sufficiently advance their autonomy technology, they may finally be able to launch their autonomous ridesharing network. While Tesla's autonomy technology is currently not yet up to par for this application, their ongoing beta has been rapidly improving with weekly updates. The beta testers have been reporting significant improvements in capability since it was rolled out a month ago.

The bet is that Tesla would be able to reach superhuman driving capability before 2025. Their location agnostic approach would let them scale up operations much more quickly than geofenced competitors (e.g. Waymo).

&#x200B;

**Insurance**

Tesla collates extensive data regarding vehicle usage and the driving patterns of their customers. Combined with their driver assist software, Tesla should be in a privileged position regarding risk assessments for Tesla customers. Using their abundant available data, Tesla may be able to prepare the most compelling insurance package for a sizable fraction of Tesla drivers.

Tesla insurance may also have a synergistic relationship with Tesla's warranty processing and service centres. Tesla insurance customers may be offered discounts on service that wouldn't be available to customers of other insurance providers.

&#x200B;

# Expectations

For public accountability purposes, I'll register my Tesla expectations for this year, next year and 2025. I'm not a financial analyst or otherwise particularly financially savvy, so I'll keep it pretty simple. I'll report my 25% - 75% confidence interval on the following metrics:

* Vehicle deliveries
* Total revenue

&#x200B;

||25%|75%|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020 Deliveries|480,000|520,000|
|2020 Revenue (USD millions)|30,000|36,000|
|2021 Deliveries|800,000|1,200,000|
|2021 Revenue (USD millions)|48,000|78,000|
|2025 Deliveries|3,000,000|5,000,000|
|2025 Revenue (USD millions)|135,000|350,000|

&#x200B;

The growing variation in the interquartile range is a representation of my growing uncertainty about the business.

I have neither a price target for $TSLA nor concrete expectations for its stock price [(I've said in public before that $TSLA might go to $200 before going to $600)](https://preview.redd.it/v86gdkbhyz061.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=b26af1f3c8bfdf0048c7f9977ba366dcb344c12a).

I simply believe that Tesla will demonstrate hyper growth over the next decade and have a > 10 year investment horizon, so I would be comfortable investing in $TSLA using dollar cost averaging.

&#x200B;

# Closing Remarks

Many are dubious regarding Tesla's ability to deliver on the formidable vision outlined above. There are certainly numerous risks that may challenge Tesla's ability to deliver on hyper growth. However, as mentioned above, the main challenge to the hypergrowth narrative is execution risks. Fundamentally, it's a question of if Tesla can execute on the vision presented above. Giving their formidable track record so far (and the comparatively less than impressive records of the sceptics), I'm willing to bet that they can.

&#x200B;

**Additional Disclosure**

While I have no financial position in $TSLA, I'm sort of an anomalous case. I only became interested in investing a couple of months ago, and I decided to defer any investments I would make until January 2021 to mitigate exposure to political risks. If I did have a portfolio, I'd expect $TSLA would feature in it (probably at around a 10% initial weighting).",2020-11-24 01:45:40

1509,Palantir Adds $17 Billion in Value in Best Week Since Debut,918,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3xd2y/palantir_adds_17_billion_in_value_in_best_week/,189,"Palantir Technologies Inc. posted its best week since it went public in September, adding about $17 billion in market value as a broad rally in tech stocks helped fuel gains in the software maker.

Its shares rose 52% since Monday and touched a fresh intraday record at $33.50. The stock lost some of the gains on Friday after Citron Research said in a tweet it was shorting the stock with a $20 target. The company ended the session at $27.66.

Palantir representatives didn’t respond to a request for comment.

“A lot of institutions have probably warmed up to the company and are viewing it as something to hold onto for the long term,” said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services. “It’s a great software company, and it has a terrific business, a very sticky business, not just with governments but also enterprises.”

Trading in Palantir options also surged this week with average daily volume of call contracts jumping about 250% in the first three days of the week when compared to the prior week. An analysis of open interest shows most of the contracts being opened and closed in the same day, indicating a heavy presence of day traders.

After an initial lackluster performance following its direct-listing stock debut, gains for the Denver-based firm, which sells data-analysis tools, have accelerated after hedge funds, including Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management, reported purchasing the company’s shares.

“Big-data companies have become very important and historically have been excellent stocks. Also, Palantir is benefiting from the pandemic -- tracking cases and analyzing data is right in its wheelhouse,” Kaufman said.

Since starting up in 2003, co-founder and chairman Peter Thiel has helped bankroll the business throughout its long period as a closely held business. Now, the stock has gained nearly 300% since its direct listing. It reported third-quarter losses in its first financial results since going public as compensation costs surged. It did, however, boost its revenue growth forecast for the year to 44%, exceeding the amount analysts expected on average.

“I’d say the days of it trading below $20 are probably over,” Kaufman added.

A lot of people are looking for the hot, sexy young stock that will beat the market and double within 5 years, but sometimes the best plays are also the most obvious. It's easy to believe ""small company will grow faster than big company"" but the large cap growth companies have economies of scale and extremely high amounts of capital to invest in both their products and expanding their market share. They also have stability, great management and brand recognition, which breeds investor confidence and makes people feel safe entrusting their money to them.

This also suggests that index funds may be safe and diversified, but if a blue chip growth company is worthy of your confidence, you're potentially better off not over-diversifying away your returns. Note: if any one of these companies completely failed and fell off the map somehow, assuming no impact one way or another to the others, the total returns of the other two would still have beaten SPY WITH that company included by a significant amount - even if the vanished company was Microsoft, the biggest returner.

I will be posting a longer term analysis shortly following this methodology back historically using the top 3 US market cap companies based on the Q1 values of the [Financial Times Global 500 each year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization). I compare buying and holding $1000 worth of shares of each of the top 3 companies each year since 1996 (when the Global 500 started) on market open Jan 1st of that year vs. buying and holding $3000 worth of SPY on the same day, with no dividend reinvestments either way. Following this methodology:

Cash basis: $75,000 (25 years x $3000)

The ""Big 3"" portfolio: $199,445

SPY portfolio: $165,164

This is including buying and holding declining behemoths like GE, CSCO and XOM which are lower today than when they were at the top.

Full of debt and in a cut throat industry where margins are slim and competition is fierce. Tesla is being priced like it will take over the world, that 1/2 cars in the world will be a Tesla. Have people forgotten that Ford, GM, Audi and BMW are all making electric cars now? Have people forgotten the self driving technology being developed by Waymo? Have people forgotten the bottomless pit companies like Microsoft have to dominate in AI and self driving?

There is virtually zero moat with what Tesla does, once the germans ramp up full self driving electric cars, where will Tesla go?

As valuations rise, a company has to deliver more and more to justify its price. Eventually it gets to a point where it can't. I want to stress that most great companies were profitable at IPO, Google was profitable, so was Facebook. Companies which don't make money but live on a fairy tale story always end in tears.

For sure there is a future for Tesla, as electric cars become mainstream, but being priced to take over the car industry is a joke and will not happen. There are many people who drive an Audi and will not drive anything else. Software wise I don't see Tesla having any major lead over Big Tech, Microsoft and Audi can very much work together on a self driving electric car.

I know Tesla is a cult and has loyal fans, but you can't compare it to Apple. Apple produce a great product (the iphone) with a massive moat (the apple ecosystem) around it, Tesla doesn't have a moat.

California Public Employees’ Retirement System, or Calpers, raised investments in Nikola ￼ (NKLA) and NIO ￼ (NIO) in the period, and nearly doubled an investment in Zoom Video Communications ￼ (ZM). It also edged up an investment in Tesla ￼ (TSLA). Calpers disclosed the stock trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The pension, which manages nearly $400 billion in assets, declined to comment on the investment changes.

Calpers bought 205,792 more Nikola shares to end the third quarter with 261,546 shares of the maker of trucks powered by alternative fuels. The pension had bought in a volatile period for Nikola stock. Shares have fallen in the second half of 2020, plunging 70% in the third quarter alone, and slipping 3.4% so far in the fourth quarter.

A short seller’s report in September alleged Nikola management overstated its internally developed battery and fuel-cell capabilities. The company disputed the report and called it misleading. Another negative report in November alleged that Nikola had considered using customers’ deposits to fund Nikola One, a truck in development that will be powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Nikola also denied that allegation.

NIO, a Chinese maker of electric-powered vehicles, has seen its American depositary receipts multiply 11 times in value this year, and have more than doubled since the end of September. Those gains far outstrip the 11% year-to-date rise in the S&P 500 index, a broad measure of the market. Since the end of September, the index has gained 6.6%.

J.P. Morgan issued a bullish note on NIO ADRs in mid-October, and the company’s deliveries were strong that month. We have noted that trading volume in NIO ADRs is at elevated levels.

Calpers bought 381,439 more NIO ADRs to end September with 2.3 million.

The pension also added 312,406 Zoom shares in the third quarter, lifting its investment to 653,764 shares.

Zoom stock has surged nearly 500% in 2020, including a 14% slide since the end of the third quarter.

1522,The technical background to Intel's problems.,886,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i73sdd/the_technical_background_to_intels_problems/,141," 

Since its’ Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its’ next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality the situation has been years in the making for those who’ve been paying attention. Today I’d like to look at some of the technical decisions Intel made, why they’ve caused problems and the implications of that on their future.

**Lithography techniques**

Lithography is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and shine a powerful laser on it [\[1\]](http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/lithobasics.html).

Over time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area – this would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling\[2\]. This becomes progressively more difficult over time, as you’re trying to cram transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‘print’ the circuit design became so relatively big that it couldn’t reliably follow the complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of thought developed to address this problem – patterning (using more than one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet, using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its’ 22 and 14nm process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on its’ 10nm process.\[3\] Meanwhile, its’ competitors TSMC and Samsung chose EUV. \[4\] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to pursue EUV for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to which was the right choice…

Other terminology I’ll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a wafer is actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of the wafer as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed from several pieces of silicon stuck together)

**The problems with 10nm**

Back in 2013, Intel was in it’s prime. It dominated the CPU market with >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its’ chips – every two years you would have a die shrink ‘tick’, then the alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‘tock’. In the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‘tock’ of 10nm in 2016. The ‘tick’ – Skylake architecture came, but the ‘tock’ never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released, 10nm still isn’t really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake in 2018 – but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not hundreds. On paper, the ‘mass-market’ generation Ice Lake launched in 2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior performance to Intel’s own 14nm offerings. \[5\] The latest update is that desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 – but for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total writeoff, and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage have doomed it to failure.    When you use lithographic techniques, you are bound to have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating billions of devices tens of atoms in size isn’t going to be perfect. Patterning as a lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect rate than not using it – you’re basically going through the same process multiple times, thus increasing the chance of defect dramatically. As I mentioned earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in 10nm – this means their defect rates are going to be sky high. At the same time, their usage of a monolithic die compounds this problem for high-performance, high core count CPU models. As you can see from the blue wafer below, it’s difficult to draw large squares (high-core count models) that are without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD’s chiplet approach, built on TSMC’s less defect-prone EUV process. 

(Sorry, I copied this post from my blog to not self-promote but I can't insert the relevant pictures here)  


Since you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you use a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting you freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to build.

Of course, it’s impossible for anyone outside Intel to know the exact numbers for the defect rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt they are improving as time goes on,as they always do with a maturing architecture. However, I can say with certainty that 

1) they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS

2) The margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%. The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only by AMD’s offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance. If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5 year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues. 

These are bold statements but I believe Intel’s actions over the past few years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view.

When you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it be ‘better’ than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent flaws that you can’t physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own previous-generation Phenom II architecture \[6\], leading to near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs, massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture. Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce 10nm high core count chips. This would’ve been fine if their monopoly continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs. Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4 cores. However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count capable Zen architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising their own core counts to compete – there has been a doubling of core counts across their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with its’ double patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of 10nm mean that current generation chips at the same price point from Intel have 14nm massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core counts outweighing any density improvements that 10nm brings. Similarly, leaks for the upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake Xeon chips suggest that the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28,  will be 33-50% lower than those from 14nm \[7\] – not to mention AMD’s offerings which top out at 2.3x the core count at half the price.\[8\] The persistent lack of chips on 10nm that can outperform their predecessors, despite us now technically being on ‘10nm+++’, suggests that there is a fundamental barrier in the technology that no amount of delays and extra engineering can get past. 10nm is rotten from the very first steps taken.

**7nm and beyond**

So now we’ve established just how much of a disaster Intel’s 10nm process is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its’ built on the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it to be Intel’s saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was widely attributed to the ‘6 month delay’ in 7nm rollout. While I don’t have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2 call were ‘we are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm… 12 months behind our internal target… we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield degradation’. 

There’s quite a lot to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call, were confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at the same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The truth is that Bob’s claim of a ‘buffer in planning process’ as the reason, while technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any typical launch of a new process node, you spend a few months getting up to speed – running the foundry through the whole process, troubleshooting, using the produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM partners for them to design products around, etc. You don’t sell the chips produced to anyone. Industry standard is to call this period a tape-out, not a launch of a new process – that’s when you actually produce chips that you sell to people. Bob’s comment translated is that the process is delayed by 12 months, but they’re going to breach industry standard and ‘launch’ 7nm when the first fabs start spinning up 6 months before they have chips in any volume. Sound ridiculous? Well, Intel did the exact same thing with 10nm. Faced with mounting pressure over the constant delays, Intel ‘launched’ Cannon Lake in May 2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole generation, a dual core processor with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was slower than the i3-3250 released in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm part. Not to mention it was nigh on impossible to actually buy one.\[9\] Cannon Lake was an incredibly obvious paper launch, released to appease investors at a time where Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake, the first 10nm architecture you could actually buy (in limited quantities) shipped in September 2019, more than a year after Cannon Lake ‘launched’. This ‘6-month’ delay is nothing more than an attempt to sweetcoat a 12 month delay (assuming no further delays).

The second part of the comment, relating to a ‘defect mode’, is just as interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information suggesting they might move away from this if it proves to be too difficult. \[10\] GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is a new and unproven transistor technology that should overcome the technical difficulties current transistor technologies face at increasingly smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is going to a completely new type of transistor and we only have one other comparable in history – the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few years ago. With FinFet, the research process from having a ‘working prototype’ demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. \[11\] Meanwhile, the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years ago. 

\[12\] While FinFeT and GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the plans from Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly ambitious. The latest leaks suggest that the ‘defect mode’ Intel have ran into has to do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true, you could easily see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is.

Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be [found.](http://found.as/) As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm. At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs. They might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've finally come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little technologies, all of which I'll explore in a future blog post. 

**Conclusion**

I’ll leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD, outsourcing production fully and writing off its’ own fabs? Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible margins from their monopolistic position?

This is repeated for the other two metrics. 

It would be nice if a company excelled at all three metrics and only received 3 points total but that's not realistic. A low profit to book value means the company stock price is under valued. If such a company also has good quarterly earnings growth and a good forward outlook then it is super under valued. And that is the point of this exercise.

Edit: this one divides eps by stock share price so we can get a more accurate picture of earnings per dollar. By doing this I noticed DAL was kind of high on the list so i'm going to add another metric of profit margin to try and weed out companies that have less cash to work with and may be at risk for bankruptcy.

Edit 2:

Ok I think this one is the most accurate. Instead of using trailing and forward eps and dividing by stock price I'm just using forwardPE. I also take into account pegRatio and if either PE or pegRatio are negative the company gets dinged hard (like with dal or luv).

So this gives us a list of companies that will survive the pandemic and are under priced.

Enjoy!

Same as above with severe penalty but in addition to having a column for priceToBook I also included one for 52WeekAverage which will give more weight to those stocks that were hardest hit. So this is is the real gem here. It should have companies with a positive future earning outlook with the lowest price.

1549,Financial Due Diligence - Guide [Part 1],836,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/etoyfk/financial_due_diligence_guide_part_1/,39,"# Introduction

My background; three years of work experience in the financial services industry for a large global firm in the area of asset management. My role is centred around financial statement analysis and basically, just performing due diligence into the fundamentals of a company. 

Anyways, the reason I decided to write up this guide for /r/stocks is that I frequent the subreddit quite often and although there are a few good posters here and there, it seems there is a lot of misinformation that goes around, and thus, I wanted to set out a foundation for a due diligence template that new investors can use so that they can have some sort of basic guideline in terms of what to look out for before buying or selling a stock.

Think of this due diligence template as your starting block. Take it, use it, then modify it to suit your needs when you are comfortable. The template is intended to be adaptable and basic.

---

# 1) What does the company do?

Step number uno; figure out what the company does. This is where google is your friend. Simply type up the company's name or ticker into google and read what it is they do.

If you don't understand what it is the company actually does after looking through google, don't invest.

If the company deals with complicated business models that require technical knowledge which you don't have, for example; an early-stage biotech undertaking Phase II clinical trials, don't invest.

If the company is vague about what it does or you're using google translator to read their business description, don't invest.

Generally, the more complicated the business model of the company, the riskier it is to invest. This includes conglomerates that may be involved in many simple business ventures individually, but when bunched up all together, it becomes complicated to analyse and thus, the risk to invest increases (e.g. GE -- to this day, I still think no one knows what they actually do).

So you're probably wondering by now, what is all this talk about *risk*? Don't worry about that for now, we will get to it later I promise.

# 2) News

What is currently happening with the company? There is no point wasting your time on further sections of your due diligence process if the company has publicly stated its intentions to file for bankruptcy.

Contrary to step 1, this is where google might not to be your friend. There tends to be a lot of spam articles, advertisements or just plain misinformation on google news. Normally, I just spend a minute on google news before doing some more serious research on better news site such as [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/) (again, simply search the company name).

Do not slack off here. The easiest way to lose money is to buy into a stock when litigations or liquidity concerns are going on which you could had easily avoided with a few minutes of reading the news.

Another reason why the news is important is that it can tell you things that aren't on the financial statements. What you read on the news can and 99% will impact the subsequent steps of this guide i.e., financial statement analysis.



# 3) Revenue drivers

Revenue is the second most important thing on a company's financial statements, in other words, how does the company make money?

If you're going to read only one thing on a company's financials (which I seriously suggest you do not do), then that one thing should be revenue.

Now, I'm not going to go into too much detail of why revenue is important. That's not the purpose of this guide, I'm not here to teach undergrad finance.

Essentially, just imagine I'm offering you to buy my lemonade stand. Now ask yourself *how you should go abouts* figuring out how much you should pay for the lemonade stand. If you don't know the answer to this, read up on the [time value of money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp) and [discounted cash flows](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp).

Anyways, let's move on. Revenue can be found on the first line item in a company's income statement. The breakdown of revenue (i.e., the drivers) can be found in the segment reporting section of the financial statements (just ctrl+f and look for 'segment').

A quick sense check I like to do here before doing anything else is revenue growth over market cap growth for the most recent period (use excel).

If market cap growth is outpacing revenue growth, that's probably a bad sign. Keep in mind that it's not an absolute indicator you should steer away, but it's just a quick and dirty calculation that gives you a general idea of where the stock is at in the market. Remember, we're trying to look for undervalued companies here, not hit blackjack at the casinos.

The two common reasons for why market cap growth is outpacing revenue growth is either that the stock is overvalued or that the market is predicting exponential revenue growth (i.e., revenue growth in the future should outpace this period's market cap growth).

Next, let's figure out the revenue drivers.

Most companies will have multiple revenue streams relating to different business operations, thus, it is important to figure out which one of those streams are driving revenue and by how much -- revenue stream divided by total revenue.

Then, we look at the growth of each revenue stream over the most recent periods. Simply looking at revenue on its own is useless without looking at growth e.g., if revenue growth is declining, you can sure as hell bet that the stock price is declining too.

Assuming you have done both of the above and listed them in descending order, you should now be able to determine which ones are the core revenue drivers.

Personally, I like to use the [BCG Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth%E2%80%93share_matrix) as a guideline when looking at the qualitative nature of the revenue drivers but everyone has their own way of doing things.

If the company is generating most of its revenue from Dogs, that's probably a bad sign.

Again, I'm not going to go through what each combination of the BCG Matrix means, have a read through the wikipedia as the information is all there.

This is usually the time when I can determine whether I should spend additional time analysing the company or move onto the next.

If you proceed, here is where things start getting quantitative and time intensive. 



*Note: In case some of you do not know where to get a company's financial statements, go to the [SEC site](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html). Simply search for the company's name, then search for filling type '10-K'.*

So as a relatively new investor, I got in at Apple at 215, Disney at 95 and also did an etf at 240. We're going to be seeing big gains tomorrow so overall I'm going to be up about  ~20%.

Chances are, the stocks will probably go up a bit more in the next few weeks and I may be prematurely selling. But I'm going to be laid off in the future and I also think that in the future, the market will drop. A 20% gain since 3 weeks ago seems solid in this uncertain market.

So I'm likely going to take the gains now and ill test the market again when that time comes.  I have a decent amount in savings but I think we're close to the peak before it'll slowly drop down. It probably won't test the March lows but hey, profit is profit.

Tesla Stock Hits $780 Raising More Than 80% Since the Start of the Year

Elon Musk’s Tesla has shut the critics with its overwhelming performance in Q4 2019. Tesla (TSLA) stock has stormed Wall Street with its price surging a whopping over 80% since the beginning of 2020.

Short-sellers are burning their hands on Tesla as the electric car maker released its strong Q4 2019 numbers last week. In less than a week, the Tesla stock has added over $200 to its price making it the first American automobile company to hit $100-billion valuations.

On Monday, February 3rd, the Tesla stock surged 20% to $780 levels taking the company’s valuations at $140 billion. Indeed, with this move, Tesla has taken Wall Street and global investors by surprise. Monday’s stock price gain was the biggest one-day surge of Tesla in the last six years.

Since the beginning of 2020, the Tesla stock price is up 85% in one-of-its-kind performance. Tesla’s stock performance has forced analysts to revise the calculation and set up new targets ahead.

Stocks don’t always recover. Industries that will most likely take a very long time to recover will be risky, and you will really need to be careful in the travel industry stocks like airlines, cruises, hotels, etc. People aren’t going to feel comfortable traveling as much, and with so many people losing their jobs, the last thing on their mind is what next big cruise they are going to go on when their pockets are empty.

Too many new investors are trying to chase stocks all the way up with FOMO, and it’s not worth it.

Too many investors don’t even understand the business they just purchased shares in, they only bought it because someone on the internet said “It’s going to the moon” or their friend said that this magical penny stock will be the next MSFT, etc.

Too many investors don’t look at the balance sheet of the companies stocks they have purchased. I have seen countless posts on here saying “This stock is about to skyrocket! BUY! BUY! BUY!” And you look into the balance sheet and you see why the stock price has been going down for 10+ years, because they are drowning in debt.

There is a company behind every stock, and unless you can understand the company and explain it easily, don’t buy the stock. Stick to what you know, or be optimistic and ready to learn about a company so you know where your money is going.

TLDR: Please read the balance sheet, and understand the company behind the stocks you are purchasing. Don’t follow the herd. Risk doesn’t always lead to reward. Have a good day!",2020-05-25 03:21:04

“Ladies and gentlemen, we are done. We have a deal,” White House aide Eric Ueland announced at the Capitol just after midnight.

White House officials said the measure will cost about $2 trillion.

Negotiators worked all day, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and incoming White House chief of staff Mark Meadows shuttling between meetings with Republicans and then Democrats.

The package includes direct deposits for all Americans, $367 billion for loans to small businesses and an unprecedented program that will allocate $500 billion to the Treasury Department. Some of that money will be used to guarantee a Federal Reserve loan program for small and medium-size businesses. Larrry Kudlow, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, said the funds could be leveraged into $4 trillion of lending through the Fed.

Most adults would receive direct payments of $1,200, while children would see $500 checks. Hospitals would receive some $150 billion under the deal and small businesses would get $367 billion in aid.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday said companies from China and other countries that do not comply with accounting standards will be delisted from U.S. stock exchanges as of the end of 2021.

Mnuchin and other officials recommended the move to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last week to ensure that Chinese firms are held to the same standards as U.S. companies, prompting China to call for frank dialogue.

Mnuchin told a White House briefing the SEC was expected to adopt the recommendations. “As of the end of next year ... they all have to comply with the same exact accounting, or they will be delisted on the exchanges,” he said.

The outbreak is spreading rapidly and cases have gone exponentially up in the last couple of days. At this time Europe is considered the epicenter with most new cases coming out of here. This is why EU countries will be shutting their borders to prevent people from moving around and spreading the virus. In the USA, all of the 50 states have also confirmed cases.
All of this bad news is hitting the markets hard. China and Japan had the smallest impacts last night with their stock markets down less than 2%. South Korea was the worst performer from the Asian markets, down 5%. Europe is still trading while this article is written at 8AM ET, but all markets are in the red around 4-5%.
The US stock futures are limit down and the ETFs are pointing to an implied open of around -6%. Oil had a bad night, down 6% and trading now around 25$.
If Europe is a guide, there will be stricter measures coming to the USA as more and more videos of people parting and going out pop up on the internet. This will further drag the stock market downward.

At the open I expect a decline and we probably will hit the circuit breaker at 7% for the S&P. This could be an intra-day opportunity since every time we have had the 15 minutes break, we sow an upward move. I would not get in the market at the open, leave the dust settle, if we hit a breaker, wait for the break and after it you can come in and Buy. As always keep your take profits and loss limits smaller, do not stay in open positions for a long period of time, take advantage of the break and get out. Sadly there is still a ways down before markets start going up.

The lack of fiscal first-quarter 2021 guidance from Apple means that investors and analysts don’t get a hint at how Apple is projecting the sales performance of the iPhone 12, which went on sale in October. 


Apple stock dropped over 4% in extended trading.

“If you look at the case count, the case counts are climbing in Western Europe. They’re climbing in the United States. And so there’s still a sufficient level of uncertainty out there… we don’t believe that’s an environment to guide into,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Josh Lipton. 

Apple hasn’t offered guidance for the past two quarters because of uncertainty related to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

However, Cook said that he was optimistic about iPhone 12 sales for a number of reasons, including 5G support, carrier promotions, and a loyal install base, and said that “initial data points are really quite good.”

iPhone revenue was down over 16% from the same quarter last year and came up short against Wall street expectations. However, many investors and analysts are more focused on how the iPhone 12 will sell in the coming year. Apple’s iPhones went on sale this year in October, and more models are planned for next month, meaning that sales from the new devices aren’t counted in this quarter.

Revenue for Macs and iPads both exceeded analyst expectations, most likely driven by strong work-from-home trends during the pandemic. Apple drew attention to strong results in those categories last quarter, too. Overall, Mac revenue was up 29% year-over-year and iPad revenue rose 46% from the same quarter last year. 

Sales in China were a weak point for Apple. Sales in greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, dropped to $7.95 billion from $11.13 billion a year before, over a 28% decrease.

“A larger percentage of China revenue is made up of new iPhones. And so that’s the reason the number for the total quarter started with a minus sign. But given what we see in the early going with the new iPhones, we’re confident we’ll grow in Q1,” Cook told CNBC.

Apple released new Apple Watch Series 6 models that went on sale in September. The category that those devices are counted in for sales is called Wearables, Home, and Accessories, which came in slightly higher than expectations. The category also includes sales from headphones such as AirPods and Beats. Sales for the category were up over 20% on a year-over-year basis. 

Investors are always closely examining Apple’s services business, which includes subscriptions like iCloud and Apple Music, fees from the App Store paid by app developers, and licensing revenue. Services revenue exceeded Wall Street expectations and grew 16% over last year. 

On Friday, Apple will release bundles of its subscription services called Apple One, Reuters reported. The bundles vary by region but include Apple Music, iCloud storage, and Apple TV+ streaming video.",2020-10-30 08:01:58

1590,A Historical Look at the Airlines,753,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gl6zrm/a_historical_look_at_the_airlines/,183,"I’ve remained bearish on the airlines for the past couple months yet the community seems to have a different perspective. In an attempt to understand why so many remain bullish I decided to take a look at how the airlines recovered following the last crises (9/11). I’ve broken down my analysis in order of the airlines market share at the time the last crises started. I’ve also shown what your return would be if you bought in late 2001 and held until today.

For context, an investment in the S&P 500 would have netted a return of **223%**

**1.** American (**-70% ROI**): Despite declaring bankruptcy, investors in American Airlines (Formerly $AMR, now $AAL) would still have a portion of their investment if they held since 2001. It’s highly unlikely investors would have held through the bankruptcy which saw $AMR get delisted and trade as low as 20c a share, but for those that held through the bankruptcy they could have sold for a gain of **100%** in December, 2019. Realistically, for someone who invested in 2001, they would have realized gains no higher than **33%** and likely sold at some point leading up to the bankruptcy.

2. United (**-100% ROI**): The original $UAL stock was wiped out during United Airlines bankruptcy proceedings. It was re-issued under $UAUA until it reverted to its original ticker $UAL after its merger with Continental airlines. Investors in 2001 would have lost their entire investment if they held without selling. On a positive note, for individuals that invested after the re-issue, they could have realized gains as high as **150%**, assuming perfect market timing.

3. Delta (**-100% ROI**): Delta Airlines faced the same fate as United, during their bankruptcy proceedings their stock was cancelled leaving investors with nothing. After emerging from bankruptcy they merged with Northwest Airlines and reissued stock under the ticker symbol $DAL.

4. Northwest (**-100% ROI**): Northwest Airlines also had their stock cancelled during their bankruptcy proceedings. They merged with Delta in 2008.

5. US Airways: **(-100% ROI**): Another airline that declared chapter 11 bankruptcy and cancelled their shares. US Airways later merged with American Airlines and currently trades under $AAL.

6. Continental (**0% ROI???**): Historical data for $CAL is hard to come by. From what I can find $CAL was never delisted or cancelled as Continental airlines never declared bankruptcy in the 2000s. They later merged with United where $CAL shareholders received 1.05 shares of $UAL. Based on the fact that $CAL was trading around $20 in late 2001, an investment held until today would have netted about a 0% ROI before dividends.

7. Southwest (**22% ROI**): We have a winner!! If you invested in the airlines after the terrorist attacks on 9/11 and chose the 7th largest airline as your bread winner you could have realized gains of 22%! Throughout the last 20 years, shareholders could have seen gains as high as **200%** if they sold near the 2018 highs. Bottom line, even with perfect market timing, an investment in an index fund would have outperformed Southwest ($LUV).

Analyzing all these companies was a lot harder than I imagined. Nonetheless, based on historical similarities between 9/11 and today's COVID-19 it’s clear any investment in the airlines is risky. A long-term investment could very easily result in a 100% loss. It might be worth performing additional technical analysis to determine if a potential swing trade could be profitable, my gut would remain bearish on swing trading but we’ll save that for a later date.

Tldr; You stand a 57% chance of losing everything based on historical trends.",2020-05-17 12:52:58
1591,PSA: Understand the gravity of the situation if you are going to buy the meme stocks and definitely do not play with what you can't afford to lose,749,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l789vc/psa_understand_the_gravity_of_the_situation_if/,204,"Building on what /u/juaggo_ has posted earlier. It is great that everyone is fighting the good fight and telling hedge funds to shove it, and I believe that this event will be impactful in the years to come.

That said, when you do buy, do it for the cause. Because you like the stock. **Because you want to expose how shit the system is**. Not cause you expect that you will make anything from this trade and that you will be able to pay of your tuition fees and home loans, or because you think that you are giving the middle finger to big money, because you are not. 

This is simply due to the sheer information and technology asymmetry.

Reddit's plan is in plain sight for all of the institutions to see. Long thesis tied to gamma and short squeeze on Friday, buy and hold and remove limits to avoid giving brokers information, ""get out before the bubble bursts"". Most new players are on platforms that they themselves understand less than institutional investors. It is hubris to assume that institutions with all their experience with manipulation and their PhDs that literally spend their entire lives studying specific topics, yes, even short interest and how it impacts the markets, will not have a counter strategy for the very obvious retail play. 

And the worst thing is that you do not know what it is; the price could be $1000 and back to $200 within minutes tomorrow if they so choose to ride the retail pump and dump, there could be no gamma squeeze at all as perhaps all of their shorts have already moved out in the dip to 100 today. What I am saying is that whatever happens tomorrow or the week after, the probability is very high that the institutions will still eat first, and the lucky initial buyers second, and the rest is likely going to be a dice roll.

On the other hand, I am going to make the sweeping assumption that most retail players have a surface level understanding on the strategies institutions are taking on this event. There has been a lot of focus on Melvin (almost a scapegoat at this point) and Citadel, but what about other players like Blackrock that are as strong and have unknown plans for the stock? Most will not understand the power dynamics between the organizations. One obvious example was Citadel snapping up Melvin in all of the chaos. Many other similar transactions are going on behind the scenes. Finally, they may underestimate the technology that they have at their disposal. People are paid millions to make their trades milliseconds faster, their codes a few percentage points more efficient - again, not resources your average investor has access to.

The bright spot is the media coverage has been very negative towards malpractices in the finance industry and there will surely be some sort of legal reform. If you are getting in this late in the game and are willing to ride or die, do it because you are bringing down RH and co., and because you are exposing more scummy practices to the world to see. Chances are you will lose the fight, but you will win the war.",2021-01-29 07:45:48

However if you accumulated all those dividends you would have made up 30% of that such that you would only be down 8%.

That requires you having the absolute worst timing. If instead you invested at the top of the ""suckers"" rally in August of 1990, you would have only lost 26%, and with reinvesting dividends you would be up 8.5%.

If instead you invested in 1988 you would only be down 20%, but reinvested dividends would make you up by 18%.

You are only down if you bought at the absolute highest point once and then never bought ever again. At both points around the top, while it seems at first you might still be down, by reinvesting dividends you actually return a small profit.

Inflation of course might mean that 18% over 30 years is a pretty bad return, it must be understood that Japan has a very low inflation rate, sometimes bordering on deflation, and their government bonds sometimes actually have negative interest rates somehow. Japan is a special place.

Normal people don't invest all their money once and then never again, so lets say you DCAed all the way down the Japanese Mega Bear by investing every December.

The money you invested in X year would be up/down Y% or Z% with dividends reinvested

1989, -38%, -8.2%

1990, -0.35%, 47%. Wait 50% returns? I mean after 30 years that isn't great but that is a far cry from this narrative that the Japanese Stock Market only losses you money. 

1991, 6%, 55%

1992, 36%, 98% - Wait how is that possible you would have doubled your money by having been invested for the entirety of the lost decades? By Listening to the Advice of Grandpa Buffet's advice of buying the dip. Even if it dips lower next time you will still be up if you have been reinvesting dividends.

1993, 37%, 97%

1994, 23%, 75%

Honestly you get the picture. While you would have lost 8.2% shirt if you invested all your money at the top of 1989, you would have gained 100% of it back if you invested an equivalent amount of money in 1992.  


Owning Japan's biggest corporations for 30 years would only lose you money if you bought at the equivalent of the peak of the Dotcom AND Housing bubble COMBINED. Even if you overpay for great companies so long as they are great companies you will be just fine as long as you are patient, and so long as you don't go all in at all time highs at the peak of a bubble. If you buy the dip, even the height of the ""suckers"" rally, you will do just fine so long as you are patient. Even with a decades long bear so long as you DCA and have patience owning reliable dividend paying blue chips stocks you can't go wrong. Could you have done better? Of course, but you can't predict the future, might as well just buy companies you want to own when you think you see a good price, or even just doing it regularly with a constant amount of money regardless of the price.",2020-06-20 20:40:06

age temperature 4.5°C above pre-industrial times for at least 
ten million years. But if CO2 concentrations reach 700 ppm,

ECS is estimated climate sensitivity, the amount that temperatures rise if CO2 concentrations double.

BAU is business-as-usual.

Alex Karp, the co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), spoke via teleconference on December 3 with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis about Palantir’s ever-expanding partnership with the government of Greece to support their COVID-19 response efforts. Dr. Karp and Prime Minister Mitsotakis were joined by Palantir Executive Josh Harris and Kyriakos Pierrakakis, Minister of Digital Governance of Greece, to explore new ways to keep Greece ahead of the curve with their public health response. 

Since the start of the pandemic, Palantir has worked with the Greek government to help enable data-driven decision-making in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic response. The government is leveraging Palantir’s Foundry software platform on top of Amazon Web Services infrastructure to deliver COVID-19 response workflows to government officials responding to the pandemic. Of particular value has been the deployment of a crisis-control center dashboard for the Prime Minister, which displays a holistic overview of the state of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece in real time.

“Our partnership with the Greek government was borne out of necessity once the pandemic began,” said Alex Karp, co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies. “We have readily played a key role in their COVID-19 response effort, which from our experience has been one of the best in the world, and we look forward to broadening this partnership for years to come.”

The Ministry of Digital Governance, leading Greece’s rapid digital transformation, played a pivotal role in facilitating the partnership swiftly, enabling top decision makers to start generating actionable insights within a matter of days. As the pandemic continues to evolve, Palantir will deliver advanced integration and analytic capabilities to a range of government initiatives, to enable data-driven decision-making.

Gather around kids, I am now ready to become a professor. First to understand shorting ratios, you need to know what outstanding shares are. There are two:

**Shares Outstanding**

The TOTAL NUMBER of shares a company has. Period. It includes: Owners, Insiders, Institutional, shares that are locked up, Available to general public, etc.

**Shares Float**

The total amount of shares to TRADE in the general Stock Market.

Pretend: Stock XYZ has *400M shares float*, *50M shares shorted*, and *daily volume of 10M shares*. Now, let’s finally get to the shorting.

**Short Ratio**

The number of *days* it would take ALL the shorts to cover their positions.

* Formula is: Shorted/Volume, so in this case: 50/10 = 5. It will take 5 days for ALL shorts to cover their positions if they were to do so.

**Short Float**

What percentage of AVAILABLE shares (Shares float) are currently being shorted.

* Formula is: ((Shorted/Available) \* 100) shares. So, (50/400) \* 100 = 12.5%.

**Short Interest** **(Shares Shorted)**

Pretty much like Short Float. The quantity of stocks that investors have sold short but not yet covered or closed out.

**Short Squeeze**

When stock price rises and the investors who shorted the stock are in RED getting a margin call. They have to immediately buy back the stock to close their position.

But… how will they close GME? The diamond hands aren’t selling. They’re riding it to the moon.

If you invested correctly on the front end, aka you identified a strong undervalued company that has great future prospects, then be confident and ready to hopefully buy some increasingly undervalued companies.

There’s a lot of stuff going on that can go south any moment.",707,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l6y2bu/psa_please_be_extremely_careful_with_your/,290,"I think that we can finally say that there is a pretty clear bubble, more or less in different  areas. The market has been acting absolutely wild as everyone can clearly see. People are pumping stocks for fun and that is worrying me a lot. If things go south, how big of a reaction will there be in the entire stock market?

Gamestop, Blackberry, AMC, Nokia have been pumped really heavily and seeing 100% gains in a single day for no reason should warn us to be alert at all times. Especially now, when many of us haven’t experienced this ever before in this big of a scale. 

While I’m really liking how the retail investors are kicking the hedge fund managers’ asses, we all should be prepared for the worst. Once people start to realize their gains and start to sell, we’re in for a wild show. And that moment will come sooner or later. That’s just a fact. People will want money at some point. When that point comes, you should have probably sold and gotten out already.

I don’t like to be bearish, but I’d say that there’s a some kind of a bubble now and it will affect all areas more or less.

Fundamentals are literally trash for people. Microsoft and Apple released some staggering all time high results yesterday and only few people seemed to give a damn about it, at least in this sub. I wonder when we’re gonna go to a different direction and pivot towards a more fundamental orientated market. It could take a long time, or it could happen next month.

Because in the end, the companies with solid fundamentals and consistant long term growth will be the ones that will perform in the long term... 

...But this is a different topic which needs to be discussed on a later date.



The saddest part of this is that the ones who suffer from this, will be us, retail investors. People will think that Gamestop, AMC & Co will only go up. That is unfortunately, not the case. 

And I’m fearing that some of us will realize that too late. Some people have bought stocks with debt and this will bite heavily in the ass, when these meme stocks go down hill. And trust me, they go down quicker than up.

People’s mental health will be on the line, when they see their brokerage accounts heavily in the cold. This is my biggest worry. How will people react to this when things go south and GME drops from their current levels.

So all I’m asking is for people to be wise with their money and put in an amount that they’re comfortable losing with. Stocks do go down. GME goes down. And everyone should be ready for it at all times.

Putting print advertising on Amazon packages is brilliant (and slightly evil) as I'm forced to look at the ad to unbox the item I bought, unlike normal junk mail which I can just blindly discard. 

Amazon also incurs no marginal shipping cost for their print advertising as its just slapped onto packages already coming to you.

Most powerful of all, Amazon knows your previous purchase history and can do unbeatable ads targeting with it to deliver superior ROI to advertisers. 

The combination of these things will allow Amazon to offer more effective print advertising at a lower price. Traditional print advertising companies don't stand a chance. ",2018-12-11 03:50:12

# **Earnings could be a positive force for stocks as Washington continues to wrangle over stimulus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/earnings-could-be-a-positive-force-for-stocks-as-washington-continues-to-wrangle-over-stimulus.html)**
*****
> Stock market optimism for a stimulus package has been rising, but the focus swings to earnings and that could be a positive for stocks in the week ahead.
*****
> JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate reports. There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.
*****
> “It looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “The guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there’s a will to get something done.”
*****
> On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. “It’s really hard to read,” said Keon.
*****
> But he said even if there’s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. 
*****
> “I actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,” said Keon.“We’re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don’t look that bad.”
*****
> Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.
*****
> Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.
*****
> “Q2 reporting season saw S&P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,” wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.
*****
> The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&P 500  down about 10%. The S&P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.
*****
> “While the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,” they noted.
*****
> The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.
*****
> Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there’s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.
*****
> “I think from the market’s perspective, it doesn’t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,” said Keon. “I think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we’re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.”
*****
> Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.
*****
> “There are many moving parts here, and they’re all moving in different directions,” said Block. “It’s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.”
*****
> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. “I think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that’s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can’t hurt,” he said.
*****
> The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.
*****
> Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.
*****
> Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.
*****
> “That would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,” said Keon.

> # Ten-Baggers Under Trump

> In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 ""ten-baggers"" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.

> At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has ""Energy"" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that ""manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control."" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a ""better and safer way to manage pain"" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.

> Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.

> Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!

> # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016

> On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)

> As shown, the average stock in the broad S&P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).

> The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.

> If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**

> Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been ""10-baggers"" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**

> While there are 46 stocks in the S&P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.

> General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.

> # News High for Net New Highs

> Yesterday, the S&P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.

> As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.

*****

> # Breadth Booming

> One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.

> While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.

> With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.

> # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950

> October’s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.

> With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month. Grey shading highlights the two historical windows of weakness that could setup our Seasonal MACD indicators.

# **Banks and health care companies will report earnings, but virus updates will matter most in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/banks-and-health-care-companies-will-report-earnings-but-virus-updates-will-matter-most-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Major banks and health care companies will be the first to reveal how the early weeks of the coronavirus shutdowns impacted their profits, outlook, work force and customers.
*****
> Earnings season begins in the week ahead, with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Johnson & Johnson among the first to release first quarter earnings reports Tuesday. But the stock market that appears to be willing to overlook anticipated bad news for now.
*****
> “Most of the slowdown occurred in March,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “Do we react to the hypernegative economic data we see? What we do react to is any semblance of guidance. There is no clarity about duration of the economic slowdown. You’re going to see a preponderance of companies pulling their guidance for the calendar year ... I think it’s going to be more companies doing that, than not.”
*****
> Stocks bounced higher in the four-day pre-Easter holiday week, with the S&P 500 up 12.1%, in the best week since 1974. Investors reacted to signs that new cases of the virus may be peaking in U.S. hot spots and Europe. The stock market also got a boost Thursday from the Fed’s announcement of a $2.3 trillion in programs to help the economy.
*****
> The market will turn its focus to earnings in the coming week, but there are also some important economic reports, including March retail sales. The virus shutdowns resulted in a rapid closing of many retail establishments, a sudden drop off in gasoline sales, and a steep decline in auto sales. That has resulted in a forecast for a 7% decline in March retail sales.
*****
> “People are more interested in news about the spread of the virus than they are about the economic data,” said Hogan. “We got another massive increase in jobless claims. That’s ignored because we’re listening to who is plateauing ... Is New York actually getting better and we see a peak? I get the feeling people are going to look at the first quarter earnings and say, ‘we know this and you should pull your guidance.’”
*****
> Before March, analysts had expected an increase of several percent in first quarter earnings. According to Refinitiv’s I/B/E/S, the forecasts and some actual numbers point to an 8.1% decline. For the second quarter, earnings are expected to decline about 20%, while economists expect an unprecedented 30% contraction in GDP during the quarter.
*****
> Weekly claims data will also be important, now with nearly 17 million claims filed in just three weeks. Economists expect millions more to be filed for the week ending April 11.
*****
> Other major banks report in the week ahead, including Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday. Hogan said companies like JPMorgan may be able to reveal how the Fed’s programs are working, both those for small business lending and others that were intended to help the credit markets.
*****
> Earnings for financial companies are expected to be down 13.7%, according to I/B/E/S data. Communications services companies are expected to have fared the best in the first quarter, with an expected 7.8% earnings gain. Health care companies are expected to see a modest gain of 1.6%.
*****
> The market will also watch Johnson & Johnson and Abbott on Thursday, as they discuss not only their results but potential developments with coronavirus-related therapies or products. J&J is working on a potential coronavirus vaccine, while Abbott has a new test kit for the virus.
*****
> ’That’s going to be the more intriguing aspect of the conference call when Abbott talks about their new test kit and how fast it is, and what they can produce,” said Hogan.
*****
> Analysts are also watching to see whether companies discuss ways they are cutting back costs. “As we go through the earnings season, what we’re concerned about is what companies are going to cut their dividends,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
> UBS Global Wealth Management strategists said in a note that 51 companies, accounting for 27% of 2019 aggregate buybacks, have suspended their repurchase programs. More capital was returned to shareholders via buybacks than dividends.

> “As a result, dividend payout ratios are somewhat low compared to other regions. So despite the expected sharp decline in profits for 2020, we expect more modest dividend cuts of 6-8%,” the UBS strategists wrote. “For now, we are assuming that the Federal Reserve does not require US banks to cut or suspend their dividends. We expect further dividend cuts in the consumer discretionary, energy, and real estate sectors. Healthcare, segments of tech, and consumer staples will likely report token dividend increases.”

Krosby said as the earnings season goes on, investors will be watching ways the economy could begin to return to normal.

“The market is moving in phases right now. The most important phase is the virus itself,” she said. She said it will matter a lot that New York continues to show positives, like a plateauing of cases and fewer hospitalizations.

Eventually companies will be able to talk about moving forward . “Are they seeing anything in terms of green shoots? Any positives? These are going to be very important as we go through the earnings season,” Krosby said. “That is complimented by when do we lift the restrictions on going back to work, and the polling data will be critical on when Americans feel comfortable going back to work, going back to a more normal environment.”

# Big Annual Declines Are Rare

> Stocks have rallied nicely off the March 23 lows on the back of a bold policy response from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and lawmakers in Washington, DC, which was followed by signs that a peak in growth of COVID-19 cases may come soon. At Wednesday’s close, the S&P 500 Index stood 19% above the March 23 closing low but down 17.7% for the year. That begs the question whether a positive year is possible with a pretty big hole still left to dig out of.

> “A positive year for the S&P 500 is still possible but will require a steady recovery in economic growth and corporate profits in the second half of the year,” noted Jeffrey Buchbinder, LPL Financial Equity Strategist. “We remain hopeful that COVID-19 can be contained over the next month or two and enable the US economy to begin to open up early this summer, but it’s just too early to tell.”

> As we see in the LPL Chart of the Day, big down years are rare. In fact, since 1950, the S&P 500 has fallen more than 15% just four times (1973-74, 2002, 2008).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Big-negative-years-are-rare.png?ssl=1))**

> All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

> So might 2020 look like 2009, a big up year for stocks as the worst of the financial crisis passed and markets looked ahead to recovery? That year the S&P 500 was down 25% year to date before rallying to end the year higher. Or is this another 1973-74, or even 2000-2002, with stocks in the doldrums for an extended period?

> Given the possibility that the bear market catalyst might be removed over the next couple of months, we expect the bear market recovery to be relatively swift by historical standards—potentially faster than the 20-month average and hopefully closer to the non-recession bear market recovery average of 10 months. The key to a possible rebound, beyond timely containment of COVID-19, will be investor confidence in recovery. The bold policy response, part of our Road to Recovery playbook, is helping bridge many businesses to the other side of the crisis.

> We think chances are good that 2020 ends up being closer to the middle of the accompanying chart rather than the far left. During these uncertain times, it’s important for investors to keep in mind that markets are forward looking. The latest bounce off of the late-March lows provided evidence that market participants are doing just that. We don’t know if a durable stock market low is in just yet, and volatility may pick up again as more bad economic news and corporate stress is revealed. Our resolve is being tested, we but we remain optimistic about prospects for a strong recovery in the second half of the year.

# Good Friday Trading: Strength Before Weakness After

> Tradition can provide some solace in these historic and trying times. So as the Hirsch household grates fresh horseradish root among other family traditions to prepare for our first tele-Seder on Zoom for the first night of Passover tonight I like to wish everyone a sweet Passover and a happy, healthy and safe Easter.

> In keeping with our traditional seasonality posts, here is the update on the trading patterns around the Good Friday NYSE Holiday. I took the picture above of the mosaic on the interior of the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Old City of Jerusalem in August 2018 on our family trip for my oldest son’s bar mitzvah. It seemed apropos for today.

> Good Friday is the one NYSE holiday with a clear positive bias before and negativity the day after. DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have solid average gains on the day before but are all net losers on the day after Easter since 1980. NASDAQ has been notably strong, up 18 of the last 19 days before Good Friday with the one loss occurring in 2017.

> The day after Easter has the worst post-holiday record though average losses are steeper after Presidents’ Day. The S&P 500 was down 16 of 20 years from 1984-2003 on the day after Easter but is has been up eleven of the last sixteen years.

# Gold Up, Dollar Down

> For a majority of the past year the US dollar has been fairly range bound, but the massive move away from risk assets more recently led to major buying for what is globally considered a safe haven currency. From its 52 week low and high on March 9th and March 20th, respectively, the dollar index rose 8.28%. But since that peak just before the equity market's bottom, the dollar index has come back down; currently ~3.25% below that high.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Dollar.png))**

> With the dollar lower, another safe haven that tends to trade inversely has benefited: gold. Since late February, the yellow metal had struggled to break out to new highs, but this week it has finally broken out. Currently, gold is at its highest level since late 2012.

# All or Nothing Days on the Rise

> We consider an 'all or nothing day' to be a day where the net daily breadth reading (daily advancing stocks minus declining stocks) for the S&P 500 is above +400 or below -400. While these types of days were practically non-existent in the 1990s, beginning in the early 2000s, their frequency started to rise with the increased popularity of trading in the S&P 500 ETF (SPY). Whereas investors used to buy and sell individual stocks, the increased popularity of SPY moved the market more towards the type of environment where investors were buying and selling the market.

> All or nothing days also increase in frequency during periods of increased market volatility, and that trend has been no different this time around either. The chart below shows the 50-day moving average of all or nothing days going back to 1990. Over the last 50 trading days, more than a third of all trading days have been all or nothing days. The only two other times where the average was higher in the last thirty years were in December 2008 and November 2011. The average got close to current levels back in late 2015 and early 2016 but was never able to quite get above 33%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040820-All-Or-Nothings-50-DMA.png))**

> Looking at the frequency of all or nothing days on an annual basis shows another interesting trend. So far this year, there have been 19 all or nothing days for the S&P 500. We may be barely a quarter into 2020 so far, but this year's total already ranks above more than half of the 31 years since 1990. In fact, the S&P 500 is currently on pace to have 70 all or nothing days in 2020, which would tie 2011 for the most ever in a given year. It's only April, but 2020 is shaping up to be the year of record volatility.

# Volatility Remains High

> Given the big rally off the lows of late March, we've had a number of questions related to the VIX and why it remains high. As of Tuesday afternoon, the VIX was in the mid-40s which is very high relative to readings over the last decade but actually down significantly from its recent highs above 80.

> The reason the VIX is still in the 40s is because the market remains volatile. While volatility is typically associated with markets that are moving lower, it can actually go both ways, which is exactly what we're seeing now. The charts below do a good job of illustrating just how extraordinary the market's swings have been in recent weeks. In many cases, it's unlike anything anyone reading this has ever seen before.

> Over the last five weeks, the S&P 500's average absolute daily percentage change has been +/-4.8%. That's higher than we saw at the height of the financial crisis, after the 1987 crash, and in the late stages of the Great Depression. The only time the S&P's average daily move over a five-week period was greater was after the Crash of 1929.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Avg-Daily-Change-25.png))**

> Tuesday's rally also puts the S&P 500 on pace for its 13th straight day of moving up or down 1% or more. That's a longer streak than anything seen during the Financial Crisis and just two shy of the 15 straight days we saw in October 2002 at the lows of that bear market. Before that, though, the only other period where there was a longer streak of 1% daily moves was during the Great Depression.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/040720-Streaks-of-1.png))**

> While 13 straight daily 1% moves is extreme by any measure, what makes this current streak even more notable is that it would be the second 13-day streak of 1% moves in the last 27 trading days. That's right, from 3/2 through 3/18, the S&P 500 went 13 straight days of moving up or down 1%. Then, on 3/19, the S&P 500 broke that streak by rallying just 0.47%. Since then, though, it's been 1% all the time again with the S&P 500 on pace for its 13 straight daily move of 1% again. Looking at this another way, in the last five weeks (25 trading days) the S&P 500 has seen a 1% move 24 times. The only other time that has occurred was during the Great Depression when there were two separate occurrences.

# Semis Holding Up Relative to Market

> In a post yesterday, we noted that the relative strength of semiconductors versus energy had finally eclipsed its record high from the dot-com boom in March 2000. Semis have not only exhibited relative strength versus the energy sector; they've demonstrated strength versus the broader market as well. Take the relative strength of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) versus the S&P 500. In the early stages of the market decline from the February highs, semiconductors saw a sharp drop in their relative strength, but in late March, the SOX surged relative to the broader market and actually hit a record high on March 24th. With Technology playing an increased role in the stay-at-home and work-from-home economy, it makes sense that semis would hold up relatively well.

> From that high on 3/24, we saw a modest pullback in the strength of the semis relative to the S&P 500, which then bounced again in recent days. Going forward, the key for the semis is over which level it breaks first. Will it be the March high or the short-term low three days later on 3/27 that followed. Whichever way it breaks will likely dictate which way the broader market goes as well.

# Health Care Gets No Booster Shot From Sanders

> Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Presidential race today, and while his chances of ever securing the nomination were slim to none, his dropping out does reduce a small amount of uncertainty. The chart below illustrates this trend as the Vermont Senator's odds to win have dropped dramatically since Super Tuesday.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/Sand.png))**

> As we have noted in the past, the odds of winning for the more progressive candidates on the Democratic ticket have typically had an inverse relationship to the Health Care sector's performance because their policies are more likely to shake up the business model of companies in this sector. Despite that relationship, Health Care stocks saw little in the way of a boost from Sanders dropping out of the race. There wasn't a single point in the trading day today where Health Care was the top-performing sector in the S&P 500, although its performance relative to the S&P 500 did pick up slightly in the afternoon after the Sanders announcement.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",2020-04-12 02:50:40
1627,Continuing our investing journey from PLTR to DTIL,696,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kxwq2t/continuing_our_investing_journey_from_pltr_to_dtil/,145,"Hey all! I'm back from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jr4xl8/posted_about_nio_6_months_ago_and_got_3_upvotes/) 2 months ago! I hope you all are still holding on to PLTR and NIO! I definitely still am. These two are definitely great companies and have much much more room to grow in the future.

I told people following me about DTIL in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/user/kotsumu/comments/kv5sj1/interesting_tech_worth_keeping_an_eye_on_dtil/) earlier this week and mentioned that I will post it for all sometime soon. I thought to post this on Monday next week, but I couldn't hold in the excitement anymore.

Let's get down to business! CRISPR, if you do not have much background, is a method patented by University of California, Berkley to use an enzyme called Cas9 and a RNA strand to modify the genetic information of organisms. I'm not going to go into detail about how it all works and r/stocks doesn't allow video links, so go to my earlier post this week to see the links to some juicy CRISPR information.

I've been following CRISPR technology for a couple years. However, the timing never felt quite right. Early last year, I was actually looking at EDIT (Editas) but after sorting through some of my thoughts and their documents, I decided not to invest. I really wanted to get into CRISPR but I always had a bias against pharmaceutical companies because of its volatile nature and dependency on drug clearances. There are other reasons but in the end, I decided not to invest and missed out on some big gains It's fine though, I make it a point to look back at opportunities missed once to learn from it and never look back again. There are way too many opportunities out there to waste time regretting. Since I didn't have a good target back then, I just threw some allocated funds into ARKG and called it a day.

You might be wondering why I'm talking about CRISPR when Precision Bioscience doesn't do anything related to CRISPR. It might be evident to you that the CRISPR space is bubbly right now. With CRSP and EDIT at all time highs, it might not be wise to jump in. Luckily for us, Precision Biosciences has their own proprietary platform, free of patents and licenses, that allows gene editing called ARCUS. There are not much information out there publicly due to the proprietary nature of the tech, but the idea seems similar. It uses a different enzyme called I-Crel to splice genes and because of its properties, it allows more precise cuts to the DNA strands that results into a less error prone process than CRISPR. The end result is the same, we are still investing in the future of gene editing, we also break free from the licensing restrictions that lock CRSP technology in pharmaceuticals. Yes, that's right, CRISPR doesn't need to only be used in therapeutics, think about what it can do for agriculture and the environment.

In summary here are the precise reasons why I'm starting a small position in Precision Biosciences (pun intended)

* CRISPR is a great new tech but most companies are in the pharmaceutical space
* CRISPR patent woes may slow down innovation
* ARCUS is proprietary and free of licensing constraints to explore the applications of gene editing and its benefits
* I have no way of validating it, but ARCUS is marketed as a less error prone CRISPR. Resulting in more precise genetic modifications.
* With all that said, I believe heavily that gene editing has huge applications in the future not limited to medicine, but in agriculture and the environment as well. Think higher yield, less maintained crops, livestock. Plants/bacteria/organisms that are engineered to solve some environment issues like plastic waste, CO2, or climate change.
* Precision Biosciences does dabble in both medical applications and food via its subsidiary, Elo Life Systems
* CRISPR companies are relatively richly valued (CRSP at 14.5B market cap, EDIT at 5B) whereas DTIL is only valued at 550M indicating that there is a lot of room to grow
* The size of their contracts are smaller, but they do have some recent strategic partnerships with high profile companies like Eli Lilly

With all that said, DTIL seems to be higher risk than some of the other companies that I've posted about previously. They have some cash on hand, albeit not much. It is still enough to give them runway till 2022 where I envision they will need to raise cash again. I plan to be a little bit more conservative with DTIL due to the nature of bio tech companies being volatile. I'll increase my position as I see fit.

As always, please do your own DD!",2021-01-16 02:27:35

1630,5 Mistakes new investors make,686,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kyf6hn/5_mistakes_new_investors_make/,217,"

5 mistakes new investors make:

1. Learning from the wrong people - Focus on learning from those who are successful/profitable investors, with a long history of outperformance. Read everything written by people like Warren Buffet and Ray Dalio, learn about finance, economics, business and accounting. 

2. Risk management - Poor or lack of proper risk management protocols and procedures is sure to cause poor, or worse, negative performance. 

3. Investing emotionally - Investing requires complete emotional detachment and objective, logical and rational thinking.

4. Unrealistic expectations - The top investors make between 19% - 35% compounding annually over periods of 30-50 years. If you think you can beat those records, for the most part you’re delusional. 

5. Not knowing what you are buying - Focus within your circle of competence and make sure you have a deep and thorough understanding of what you own. Do your research.",2021-01-16 19:24:18

1632,Some interesting news in the stock market this week,687,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/dx5whz/some_interesting_news_in_the_stock_market_this/,65,"On Wednesday **Nike** announced that it was to stop selling its clothes and shoes directly to customers on **Amazon**. The move is a potential watershed moment for the retail industry in general (and Amazon in particular) as strong brands realize that traffic driven to their own site is self-sustaining, more profitable, and actually brand enhancing.  That’s good news for brands and bad news for Amazon.

**Disney** had a good week with over 10 million signing up for its new streaming service. There were a few initial technical glitches but overall the app and the backlog catalogue were well received. The Star Wars based series, The Mandalorian, also received very positive feedback. However some commentators noted the lack of content for adults and questioned how long customers would be happy to watch the old classics. It’s an important question for Disney. The catalogue of classic content gives it a head start but it will still need to get up and running fast with consistent high quality (and expensive) new material. 

**Alphabet** said it was exploring ways it could “partner with banks and credit unions in the US to offer smart checking accounts through Google Pay, helping their customers benefit from useful insights and budgeting tools,”. It’s the latest attempt by the company to break into the highly regulated world of finance. However, the partnership approach with banks (rather than competing with them) seems more likely to succeed and the opportunities for Alphabet to provide useful tools and Google Pay should benefit all parties. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Growth stocks (Farfetch, Amarin and Grocery Outlet)** 

**Farfetch’s** stock is up 29% following a Q3 earnings beat with revenues up 90%, GMV up 59%, gross profit up 70% and guidance raised. 

Farfetch is a high-end fashion retailer that carries no inventory which is a major advantage when the risk of getting stuck with expensive stock you cannot sell is significant. Instead the company runs an online marketplace where more than 1,000 retailers and 3 million customers from over 50 countries.  Growth has been spectacular with revenue increasing by 50%+ for several years in a row.  

Significantly, Farfetch reported that the site’s top 10 brands (including Gucci, Prada and Fendi) had doubled the amount of stock they listed on the site (versus a year ago) and that more than 100 new luxury brands (including Stella McCartney and Brunello Cucinelli) have joined the platform.

This rapid growth has led to increasing networking effects and allows Farfetch to charge a 25% to 33% commission fee on sales made through its site. Current year forecast sales are still modest at just under $1 billion. Equally modest, in comparison to the opportunity, is the current market capitalization of $2.74 billion. The $300 billion global market for luxury products is in the midst of a structural shift to online and Farfetch, with its network effects, is in prime position to benefit. 

&#x200B;

**Amarin** rose 33% in a week that saw the FDA Advisory Committee vote unanimously to recommend approval of Vascepa label expansion.  However its current valuation (market cap $8.62 billion) still looks cheap compared to the huge opportunity that looks increasingly like it is about to become a reality.

Vascepa is currently approved to reduce triglycerides. The label expansion under consideration would allow it to be prescribed to prevent cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes that affect millions of patients in the United States and are estimated to cost $500 billion annually. That’s not all up for grabs, but Amarin estimate there are 50 million people in the US alone who could benefit from the drug.  30% of that market at $1,000 p.a. would yield $15 billion in the US alone.

&#x200B;

**Grocery Outlet** reported strong Q3 earnings on Monday with revenues up 13.1%, comparable store sales up 5.8%, adjusted net income up 58.8% and adjusted EBITDA up 13.2%. Full year guidance was raised across the board with EPS rising from 69 cents to 73.5 cents at the midpoint (and comparable to 18 cents last year).

The company has been called the TJ Maxx of grocery and its business model is very similar. It sells branded goods at discounts of 40%-70% by acting as a clearing channel for producers. That offers a treasure hunt experience for buyers and useful way to offload excess inventory for producers. 

I was initially sceptical of the ability to implement the model for grocery but the results speak for themselves. It is true that the company has to buy and sell certain staples such as bread and milk like any other grocery store. However it appears that there is a huge range of goods (dry goods, cereals, wines, deli, frozen etc) that lend themselves very well to the model. Opportunistic purchases of fresh produce such as meat, fruit and vegetables enhance the product range.

The two drivers for this business are;

1.  There is a huge opportunity, Grocery Outlet currently has 330 locations but believes there is demand nationwide for 4,800 stores

2. Grocery Outlet (similar to TJ Maxx) is establishing itself as the go to market place for both producers and consumers. That leads to a virtuous circle of more high quality goods, more variety, more customers, more high quality goods.

The stock isn’t cheap on 43x current year estimates but the valuation appears very justifiable.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Value stocks (Tyson Foods and Verso)**

**Tyson Food's** rose 10% this week despite narrowly missing estimates on the top and bottom line and reporting a 33% drop in EPS (from the record year that was 2018). Nevertheless Q4 sales were up 9% and CEO Noel White said “We’re very optimistic about fiscal 2020, and we currently expect to meet or exceed our long-term earnings algorithm of high single-digit adjusted earnings per share growth as we’re well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in the global marketplace.”

That optimism seems well placed. Tyson reported that its in-house rival to Beyond Meat, Raised & Rooted, now supplies fake-chicken nuggets to around 7,000 stores. Significantly more than the 4,000 it had previously estimated.

It also bodes well for other Tyson Raised & Rooted products; the chicken nuggets were essentially a pilot offering. The next one that'll hit store shelves is a blended hamburger that's a combination of Angus beef and plant protein.

The company also received a welcome boost on Thursday when China lifted its 4 year ban on US chicken products. All in all the stock looks relatively cheap (no pun intended). Even after the rise the stock is valued on a trailing PE of 16.36 and just 13.5x current year estimates. That compares favourably to the 5 year historic annual growth rate of 16.5%.

&#x200B;

**Verso Corporation**, the paper and pulp company, has struggled as demand for paper products has weakened. However my interest was aroused by the announcement this week that it has agreed the sale of Androscoggin and Stevens Point Mills for $400 million. The intention is to return a significant portion of the net proceeds to stockholders either by way of dividend or share repurchase. 

Now, I will highlight that I don’t know much about this industry and I expect there are many risks and costs involved with the business and the potential to offload the other mills. Nevertheless $400 million is a significant sum for a company with a market capitalization of $640 million. The company is currently valued at well under book value, has negligible debt and those 2 mills only account for around 20% of total capacity. If anyone has an insight it would be great to hear it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Speculative (****SmileDirectClub****)**

**SmileDirectClub,** the online startup disrupting the orthodontic industry, saw its shares fall 26% after its earnings report on Tuesday failed to impress. Third quarter sales surged 50.6% to $180.2 million but losses widened (as expected) to $88.3 million from a loss of $14.9 million in 2018. 

However, in my opinion, the short term quarterly results are of little importance. To understand the value of the company you must balance the huge potential opportunity that faces SmileDirectClub against the pending legislation that could impose harsher regulations on online dentistry companies. 

It is estimated that there are 124 million potential orthodontic customers in the U.S. and half a billion worldwide.  That's a total addressable market of $245 billion in the U.S. and $700 billion in the rest of the world. That is a global TAM of $945 billion compared to SmileDirectClub's current market cap of $3.3 billion.

The outcome of litigation processes are always extremely difficult to call. Nevertheless the stock offers a good balance of risk and reward. It is very high risk and potentially extremely high reward. Please be aware that this is a HIGH RISK highly speculative stock.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Insider (Comscore)**

**Comscore’s** new CEO, Bill Livek, snapped up $1 million of stock on Tuesday (along with a few other insider purchases) following Q3 results last week. That should only enhance the strong incentives already in place for him to deliver a sale of the company at an advantageous value for investors. Livek, a 30-year veteran of the media and data measurement market, will receive a $1 million cash bonus from a sale. However, he will get an additional cash bonus (based on a percentage of the gross transaction if the sale yields $500 million or more in proceeds). That’s an 85% premium to Friday’s closing market capitalization of $270 million.

1636,What do analyst recommendations really mean?,679,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gh1pe7/what_do_analyst_recommendations_really_mean/,94,"Often I see people either taking analyst recommendations seriously, or saying that Wallstreet analysts are a bunch of idiots. Neither is true. The important thing to understand here is that it’s actually not their job to help retail investors (you) make money. Here’s how Wallstreet actually works:

Most research analysts work for banks. You probably know that these analysts get paid very good salaries. But research in and of itself doesn’t generate revenue. So how is their existence justified? 

Let’s first talk about how banks actually make money. Banks generate revenue via corporate activities – these include both equity and debt financing deals – when a company sells new stock to investors, Wallstreet takes a clip. They also take a clip when a company issues new debt. It is true that investors pay Wallstreet some commissions to trade stock and to consume research, but those are dwarfed by fees for facilitating debt and equity issuance. Wallstreet also makes big fees when companies buy one another, so called mergers and acquisitions.

So as a bank, you want to do everything you can to get a company to choose you when they are selling additional securities. How do they do this? Well one good way is to write flattering research about the company. A research analyst at an investment bank is not supposed to make recommendations that help investors make money, the research analyst is supposed to make recommendations that maintain good relations with the company, so that their ECM, DCM and M&A teams can get deals that make the bank money. 

If we take an example – some people have asked me why do research analysts keep upgrading Tesla’s stock price target as the share price goes up? No, it’s not because they are stupid. No, it’s not because they can’t see that Tesla is more expensive than all the other US automakers combined. Yes, they can see that the stock price went up while Tesla stopped making cars. BUT Tesla is a company that requires a lot of money (maybe even more now due to their production delays)! And that means both equity issuance and debt issuance. The ECM and DCM bankers are sitting there salivating at the fees that they can make as long as Elon picks them as the lead bookrunner. And these are the guys that get paid the big bucks on Wallstreet – they go and have a word with the manager of the guy that writes about Tesla, a much lesser earner, and make it clear that they need their firm to stand out as the most bullish on the street, so that Elon chooses them for his next raise. Consequently all of Wallstreet falls over each other to keep upgrading in the hopes of getting into the company’s good graces. It’s twisted, but this is just how Wallstreet works. 

This is also why there are no upgrades for boring cheap and profitable companies. They don’t need Wallstreet, so Wallstreet doesn’t talk about them. On the other hand, if you are a money burning software company that pays their employees in stocks? No problem, no profits required – you will get upgrades. Research analysts are required to tie themselves into knots to justify any stock price, lest their delicious bonus will look an awful lot less delicious. 

The same goes for companies that like to make acquisitions – cash rich guys with a bit of an empire building streak – here Wallstreet wants to pander to them to make money on the acquisition streak – think Allergan before it blew up. Also companies that are in areas where a lot of M&A activity is going on – guys that may be purchased by said acquirers – Wallstreet wants to pump these up to make a bigger fee when they get taken out!

Of course, the issue with buying into this is that it can blow up at any moment. Wallstreet can’t manipulate the whole market. Wallstreet also doesn’t care if Tesla goes to $300 and all the “suckers” (as they call them) who bought based on their recommendations lose money. Once Wallstreet can’t make money out of a company, they don’t care about it anymore. They will still be laughing all the way to the bank.  

**TL;DR: Wallstreet analysts are a bunch of self-interested cheerleaders. Don’t expect them to produce any actual research based on facts. Just like you, they want to make money.**",2020-05-11 00:41:39

CVRS ran from $1.30 and eventually got bought out at $4.25/share. Guardant Health ran from $30 to $112 with blow-out earnings quarter after quarter.

As the bull market charges into 2020, here are 3 stocks under $20 billion market cap that I'm bullish about. Let me know if you enjoy these types of posts, and I'll come out with more picks in my portfolio!

**Guardant Health (**[**$GH**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GH&amp;amp;ty=c&amp;amp;ta=1&amp;amp;p=d)**):**

""Guardant Health, Inc. is a precision oncology company. The Company is focused on helping conquer cancer through use of its blood tests, data sets and analytics.

Its Guardant360 process includes blood collection, laboratory processing, analysis and reporting. Guardant360 is used for a range of applications, including translational science research and identifying target patient populations, drug development and commercialization post-drug approval.""

**WHY?**

Guardant Health received expanded Medicare coverage for Guardant360, making it the first and only liquid biopsy to be broadly covered for use across the vast majority of advanced solid tumors.(!!!) -- For the Q3 2019 earnings report, Guardant procured an aggressive revenue increased by 181% ($60.8M). The bottom line earnings also improved by the remarkable 92.7%. If Guardant can maintain this momentum, it will generate positive cash flow within the next two to three years. Other catalysts: Monday, January 13 the company will be participating in the upcoming 38th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, CA. Imminent FDA approval within 1-2 years.

Global automakers have begun to gradually resume operations factories after curbs on public movement prevented workers in many countries from commuting. But they face weak demand as job losses and concern about an economic downturn weigh on consumer spending.

“The coronavirus has dealt us a bigger shock than the 2008 global financial crisis,” Toyota President Akio Toyoda said at a live-streamed media briefing.

“We anticipate a big drop in sales volumes, but despite that, we are expecting to remain in the black. We hope to become a leader of the country’s economic recovery.”

Toyota forecast an operating profit of 500 billion yen ($4.66 billion) for the year through March 2021, down 80% from 2.44 trillion yen in the year just ended. That would be its weakest profit since the 2011/12 financial year.

1657,NIO Manufacturing TL;DR (with currencies translated to USD),644,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jmh8vh/nio_manufacturing_tldr_with_currencies_translated/,157,"Hey all, 

Read through the 10-K filings and figured I would highlight the risk catalysts and manufacturing agreements NIO is currently involved with to give you a better idea of their output forecast and so you can research yourself as to whether or not they can be sustainable: 

> We have entered into an arrangement with Jianghuai Automobile Group Co., Ltd., or JAC, for manufacturing the ES8 for five years. In April 2019 and March 2020, we entered manufacturing cooperation agreements with JAC for the manufacture of the ES6 and the EC6, respectively.

---

> The ES8 and ES6 are manufactured in partnership with JAC at its Hefei manufacturing plant. JAC is a major state-owned automobile manufacturer in China and it constructed such Hefei manufacturing plant for the production of the ES8 (with a modified production line for the ES6) and potentially other future vehicles with us.

---

> **we pay JAC for each vehicle produced on a per-vehicle basis monthly for the first three years.**

---

> In addition, for the first 36 months after the start of production, which commenced on April 10, 2018, to the extent the Hefei manufacturing plant incurs any operating losses, we have agreed to compensate JAC for such operating losses. Cooperation after the first 36 months will be subject to further negotiation between the parties.  As of December 31, 2019, we had paid JAC a total of $90,310,656.80, including $49,772,468.20 as compensation for losses incurred in 2018 and 2019 and $40,538,188.60 for manufacturing and processing fees.

---

Risk catalysts mentioned: 

> Beginning July 1, 2018, the tariff on imported passenger vehicles (other than those originating in the United States of America) was reduced to 15%. As a result, our pricing advantage could be diminished.

*(In English: The trade war between the West and China is killing any chances of NIO achieving market share in places outside of China.)*

---

> Pursuant to the 2018 Negative List, the limits on foreign ownership of auto manufacturers were lifted in 2018 for NEVs and will be lifted by 2022 for ICE vehicles. As a result, foreign EV competitors could build wholly-owned facilities in China without the need for a domestic joint venture partner. For example, Tesla has started constructing a factory in Shanghai without a joint venture partner. These changes could increase our competition and reduce our pricing advantage.

*(In English: China is incentivizing FDI (Foreign Domestic Investment), which is leading to competition from corps like Tesla who are much more established and have the funds to outpace NIO.)*

---

> We believe that our sales performance of ES8 and ES6 in 2019 was negatively affected by the reduction in the subsidy standard. The current 2020 subsidy standard, effective from April 23, 2020, (i) reduces the base subsidy amount in general by 10% for each NEV, (ii) sets subsidies for 2 million vehicles as the upper limit of annual subsidy scale; and (iii) provides that national subsidy shall only apply to an NEV with the sale price under $44,826.60 or equipped with battery swapping module. Further, the 2021 and the 2022 subsidy standard are expected to be reduced by 20% and 30% respectively as compared to the standard of the immediate preceding year.

*(In English: Less government incentive = lower operating margin = less revenue growth.)* 

---

> Our servicing will primarily be carried out through third parties certified by us. Although such servicing partners may have experience in servicing other vehicles, we and such partners have very limited experience in servicing our vehicles. Servicing electric vehicles is different from servicing ICE vehicles and requires specialized skills, including high voltage training and servicing techniques

*(In English: NIO cannot afford to achieve [vertical integration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/verticalintegration.asp) yet and relies heavily on outsourcing to other, much smaller companies to get certain jobs done. Their supplier network is likely to be inefficient at times and falter under macroeconomic headwinds like government intervention (think trade war and tax credits) and covid-19 and this makes NIO's operations all the more compromised.)*

Some outside data to look at: 

[China Total Vehicle Sales: 1997 - 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/total-vehicle-sales)

*Overall seems incredibly cyclical but in an upward trend over the next 5 years. Long term investors shouldn't worry about demand.* 

[China GDP Annual Growth Rate: 1989 - 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/gdp-growth-annual)

*China believe it or not is still considered a developing country which is defined by its high GDP growth rate and low standard of living. It averages 6% a year but due to covid fell harshly. Right now it is sitting at 4% but is expected to return to 6% within the next two years.* 

[China Consumer Confidence Index: 1991 - 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/consumer-confidence)

*Consumer confidence forecasts are predicted to rise as the world recovers from covid-19. This in turn can translate to increased spending and economic stimulation (aka more potential demand and orders for NIO vehicles.)*

[China Car Production: 2005-2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/car-production)

*China is set to return to the 25 Million vehicle production milestone it often flirted with over the past decade. Should it overcome the impact on manufacturing from covid and the trade war, it may very well achieve even higher historical output although that is a very optimistic outlook given the current geopolitical situation.*

---

My personal outlook: 

I'm getting a lot of comments assuming that I'm bearish on NIO. Overall I'm neutral but hopeful that there is more to come once they move past their growth phase. Here is what I think they need to focus on to achieve Tesla levels of growth: 

* Achieve vertical integration to lower cost of goods sold as much as possible 

* Focus primarily on R&D investments (management has been doing that!) 

* Don't focus on international expansion. That can wait until after they've established a steady footing financially and have achieved a significant market share in China. Right now international expansion is too expensive and risky given they are still in a growth phase and cannot be 100% confident in the numbers from the factory or the sentiment from customers. 

* Make sure Tesla does not succeed in China. It currently has a factory and is working on fighting NIO for market share. If Tesla wins NIO will remain a smaller competitor and not achieve nearly as much growth as people are hoping for. I see a lot of people banking on them monopolizing the EV market in China. That is a naive assumption at this time and it is still anyone's guess as to who will come out on top once the dust has settled. 

* Pray for tax incentives. Tesla did so well in the states because the fed and state authorities gave tons and tons of tax credits for renewable energy investments and made it very attractive to buy electric vehicles.

This reminds me of a terrific story of Bob, the worlds worst timer of investing.

For those that are busy, here are the lessons from Bob’s story:


If you are going to make investment mistakes, make sure you are biased towards optimism and not pessimism. Long-term thinking has been rewarded in the past and unless you think the world or innovation is coming to an end it should be rewarded in the future. As Winston Churchill once said, “I am an optimist.  It does not seem too much use being anything else.”



Losses are part of the deal when investing in stocks.  How you react to those losses is one of the biggest determinants of your investment performance.



Saving more, thinking long-term and allowing compound interest to work in your favor are your biggest accelerants for building wealth. These factors have nothing to do with picking stocks or a complex investment strategy. Get these big things right and any disciplined investment strategy should do the trick.",2020-02-25 08:13:43

It remains the mystery at the heart of Boeing Co.’s 737 Max crisis: how a company renowned for meticulous design made seemingly basic software mistakes leading to a pair of deadly crashes. Longtime Boeing engineers say the effort was complicated by a push to outsource work to lower-paid contractors.

The Max software -- plagued by issues that could keep the planes grounded months longer after U.S. regulators this week revealed a new flaw -- was developed at a time Boeing was laying off experienced engineers and pressing suppliers to cut costs.

Increasingly, the iconic American planemaker and its subcontractors have relied on temporary workers making as little as $9 an hour to develop and test software, often from countries lacking a deep background in aerospace -- notably India.",2019-06-30 14:51:36
1662,Musk to Tesla employees: 'Our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffle under a sledgehammer!' if we don't control costs,636,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k4uytz/musk_to_tesla_employees_our_stock_will/,133,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent an email to employees Tuesday warning they will have to control costs in order to maintain the company's streak of narrow quarterly profits.

""Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profitability but if, at any point, they conclude that's not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffle under a sledgehammer!"" Musk wrote in the email, which was obtained by CNBC.

Tesla shares continue to trade at all-time highs, and the stock will join the S&P 500 later this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent an e-mail to employees on Tuesday warning them that they need to control their spending in order to continue squeaking out quarterly profits, even though shares of Tesla are trading at all-time highs ahead of the company's inclusion in the S&P 500.

This year, among other things, Tesla began spending to build a new factory near Austin, Texas, and another near Berlin. The company also embarked on a makeover of its paint facilities, which are part of its U.S. vehicle assembly plant in Fremont, California.

""Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profitability but if, at any point, they conclude that's not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffle under a sledgehammer!"" Musk wrote in the email, which was obtained by CNBC.

Electric vehicle news site Electrek previously reported the contents of Musk's email.

In early 2020, amid sluggish auto sales the world over, Tesla cut some employees' pay temporarily, slashed contracts with temporary workers and fired an undisclosed number of workers after an annual performance review process. It has since rehired contractors and restored employee pay.

The Tuesday e-mail echoes previous statements by Musk but does not specify how Tesla plans to mind its budget.

On the company's third-quarter earnings call, Musk told analysts and shareholders, ""We're trying to spend money at the fastest rate that we can possibly spend it and not waste it.""

But on that same call, Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn said Tesla plans to ramp up its capital expenditures by $2 billion versus its prior stated plans to $2.5 billion in 2021 and 2022. Among other things, he said, the increased spending would enable Tesla to ""in-source"" things like some of its battery cell manufacturing.

Tesla raised $5 billion in September through an equity raise but needs to pay down about $1 billion in this, its fourth, quarter related to converts.

Shares of Tesla were trading above $580 ahead of the market's close on Tuesday.

Some news about  DKNG, PENN and other stock market news for today.**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! First of all, I wanted to wish to everyone happiness, peace and prosperity this upcoming Christmas, hope you are all doing well, Merry Christmas everyone.

And let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/syhtLB9) leading the way, finishing up .38%, with the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/p4bcpsq) also barely finishing in the green for the day up .07% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/XtPLRkZ) finishing in the red .29%.

We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/1MHj5jB) dropping again today by 3.8% despite being even lower but seeing a pop in the last hours of trading with a spike of more than 4% with more uncertainty being created in the Congress after Trump [vetoed](https://ibb.co/7RpRq4W) the defense bill, as he continued to distract the attention from the big number of [pardons](https://ibb.co/pn5ZGcn) he keeps giving out, with the latest round bringing the total to almost 50 in the past week.

More than 60% of the companies were gaining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/wB1W5gZ) with over 200 new highs, but the volume was relatively low in this shortened trading week, as 8 of the 11 SP [sectors](https://ibb.co/tDMkjKc) were gaining yesterday with Energy and Financials gaining more than 1.6% with Financials gaining a boost as the [Treasury](https://ibb.co/XFcwxzV) yields pushed up and the curve continues to steepen, while the laggards were Real Estate, Technology and Utilities as value plays especially small and mid-caps outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/J3LB8fZ), with the large-cap growth companies finishing the day down by more than half a percent.

You can see this exact thing in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/QJ78SkH) as the 3 biggest companies in the world, Apple, Amazon & Microsoft, finished the day down more than 0.6%. You can also see that most of the gains were concentrated in the banks and oil & gas industry while the rest of the market was pretty much mixed with companies like Tesla, Google, Facebook having small gains, while others like Zoom, Netflix, Airbnb and many more suffered.

Yesterday we also got the AAII [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/phzNq0d) that shows how investors were feeling last week. This time we don’t get any good news as this is a contrarian indicator, as people started to move from a bearish sentiment to a more neutral sentiment with more than 4% of investors moving from a bearish view to a neutral view, with only a .1% increase in bullish investors last week, as the stimulus bill seemed to be finally agreed on before Trump making new headlines this week again with the Veto of the NDAA.

Meanwhile we also got tons of economic data yesterday starting with initial and continuing [jobless](https://ibb.co/bg8K6Dt) claims as initial claims came in way [lower](https://ibb.co/n81QxT6) than expected just over 800K, down almost 90K from the previous week and falling to a 3-week low, with the continuing jobless claims also dropping to 5.3M, lower than last week and what was expected from the analysts.

We also saw the durable goods [number](https://ibb.co/DYN5hkb) coming in better than expected with a .9% increase, up for the 7th straight month, while house [PRICES](https://ibb.co/DKms26p) rose nationwide by 1.5% in October from the previous month, which continued to push house prices higher by more than 10% since last year, with home [SALES](https://ibb.co/xhLcYy5) falling in November but are still up over 20% year over year as the median sales price of new houses continued to trend up.

Alongside this we saw the final consumer sentiment read slipping in [December](https://ibb.co/GV1yS3f) to 80.7, lower than expected but higher than the 76.9 in November, with the November Personal [INCOME](https://ibb.co/0QCHRdN) coming worse than expected, losing 1.1% from the previous month.

In contrast, [today](https://ibb.co/74kjcZD) we don’t really get any critical economic data and the stock market closes early.

So, we saw Nikola take another stumble [yesterday](https://ibb.co/319S2TR), after the whole Apple & Tesla [disruption](https://ibb.co/n897DvD) as we saw the stocks drop more than 10% again yesterday and is down more than 26% since I made my prediction and just hit my first price target, here is the link to that [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k4l6x3/tesla_news_nio_sales_nikola_stock_crash_stock/).

Nikola shares skid [yesterday](https://ibb.co/zhjQhMq) again after another deal for the company fell, as that meant the termination of the deal with Republic Services to develop an electric garbage truck for them. The deal was expected to have Nikola produce over 2500 trucks for the company. So, I would trim my sell position on Nikola here, while leaving some for my next target, with that target being a drop in the single digits in the future for the company.

In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/V3JdsFX), we saw Alibaba shares plummeting again more than 8% on the Hong Kong exchange and more than 7% in pre-market in the US by [now](https://ibb.co/7VXxMCC), after more pressure has been put on the company as the Chinese authorities are continuing to pursue anti-monopolistic investigations on the company while also continuing the investigation on Ant Group which is an affiliate of Alibaba as they hold more than 1/3 of the company. I think these investigations are very likely to come out with fines and structural changes on how the company will work with its subsidiaries and affiliates, and that the high flying, record-breaking, Ant Group IPO will likely be postponed for a longer period until they meet regulators requirements as it is expected that Ant Group will be given some guidelines to follow by the [regulators](https://ibb.co/kBm5431). My personal belief is that Alibaba is a great company and it should trade higher than this, but until this whole mess with the authorities clears, anything can happen as you can see in this [CHART](https://ibb.co/ssR3Ld6), as the stock has underperformed since Ant Group canceled the IPO, with my long-term price target for Alibaba being 300$, but I wouldn’t go to heavy on this trade right now.

Enough of Alibaba, meanwhile we also saw XL Fleet jumping huge [yesterday](https://ibb.co/MP9XBv2) after the usual short-seller Citron, indicated that there is still more upside for this company.

And one final piece of [news](https://ibb.co/6Zp3qMw) is that Colorado set another record for wagers in November, this is another confirmation of the gambling tailwinds that will skyrocket companies like DraftKings & PENN Gaming higher in the next years.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/QvL0MV4) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the Nasdaq Composite leading the way, while the European Union and UK are finally nearing a deal for [Brexit](https://ibb.co/M9pkZxY), and remember there are only 5 trading sessions left in 2020 with today also being a short-day of trading.

Also, don’t forget this is usually when one of the best 7-day period for gains happens, with an [average](https://ibb.co/QbcDDrh) return of 1.33% and a 77% chance of that happening since 1950. But be careful, not every year is a winner, you can see [here](https://ibb.co/16STGsc) some examples, with 1999 being a very bad year as the dot com bubble approached, with another bad year coinciding with the start of the financial crisis. Hopefully this will be the 5th straight year with a positive return in this period.

Have a great day and see you next time!",2020-12-24 23:58:52

 A [recent MIT study](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/16M1102094) looked at various games to see how much “skill” was actually involved. Coin flipping, one would think, would be 0% skill and 100% chance. While chess—a turn-based game where both players see all information at all times—would be 100% skill. The MIT scientists “reasoned that if a game were more skill-based, then a player’s performance should be persistent. It might be good or bad, but it would remain relatively constant over multiple rounds.”      

On a scale of zero (pure luck) to one (pure skill), coin flipping indeed ranked a zero. But moving back towards the stock market, the study also looked at **45,000 mutual funds’** performances from 2005 to 2015, and ended up giving mutual funds a score of **0.32**.

Here's the link to that: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ice312/a_guide_for_those_looking_to_invest_in_renewable/

-----------------------

I'm going to update you all on my portfolio allocation and any important news from the companies. The stocks are listed in order by % of my renewable portfolio.

**NOTE**: I've added to several of my positions and increased my cost basis so my personal % gain might be down in some of these stocks despite drastic price appreciation. 

---------------------

**Tesla** **(TSLA)** : (19% gain from my last post) (654% gain total)

(41% of my renewable portfolio)



----------------------

I'll focus on recent updates from Tesla's solar business because this post is about renewables. First of all, battery day in September announced plans with a future goal of 56% price reductions in Tesla LIO batteries. This applies to Tesla's energy storage business and will make their Powerpack and Megapack the most affordable energy storage solutions in the market. They've also cut prices on their solar panels and solar roof products. 

Tesla is still a strong buy in my opinion. It's incredibly volatile but in the long term I see Tesla being the most valuable company in the world.

------------------------

**SolarEdge** (**SEDG)**: (32% gain from my last post) (88% gain overall)

(12% of my renewable portfolio) 

-------------------

There isn't much recent news from SolarEdge. They continue to dominate the global inverter market and have been given a series of analyst upgrades. The only notable piece of news of late is a $550 private stock offering to raise money for future expansion.

I'm still bullish on SolarEdge and I believe they will be crucial in the renewable future. I added several shares and more than doubled my position in September when the stock price dropped under $200. However, they trade at a premium P/E ratio right now and are overvalued by most traditional metrics. If you are a long term investor I think you'll be rewarded for buying in at these prices but don't be too surprised if there's a stock price correction in the near future. 

------------------------

**Canadian** **Solar** **(CSIQ)**: (59% gain since my last post) (74% gain overall)

(9.20% of my renewable portfolio)

---------------------

Canadian Solar also had a private stock offering of $200 million to raise capital recently. They sold a solar project to BluEarth Renewables and are announced another project in Mexico. The big piece of news here is that they are preparing a ""Carve out IPO"" of their Chinese module and systems solutions business. This allows investors in China to own part of this specific subsidiary of CSIQ. It provides Canadian Solar with additional capital to expand in China, which is the world's largest solar market. 

Canadian Solar has also seen industry consolidation towards the top players in module manufacturing, which includes themselves. This is a great trend for their future prospects. I added a ton of CSIQ when their stock price dropped in September. I'll keep adding on any dips.

Yes, Canadian Solar's stock has gone up tremendously in the past month. However, they are still undervalued in my opinion and trade at a measly P/E ratio of under 10. This is another long-term hold for me if you're willing to ride out the volatility.

------------------

**Jinko** **Solar** **(JKS)**: ( 136% gain from my last post)  (182% gain overall) 

(8.3% of my renewable portfolio)

---------------------

Jinko Solar reported a blowout quarter last week, beating on earnings by 97%. In other news, they are set for an IPO of their subsidiary in China's stock market. This has further increased their stock price and led to additional capital for expansion. Jinko is another company poised to benefit from industry consolidation, specifically in China. They've begun developing projects in Vietnam and Japan, plus they have many more in their pipeline.

Jinko has shot up an absurd amount recently. It seems like every day they're up another 10%. I'm expecting a slight correction in the short term, but you could miss out by not buying at these prices. Overall, I think Jinko has unique access to the Chinese Solar market and will continue to grow their top and bottom lines for their foreseeable future. Because of this, I consider Jinko a long-term buy and hold even at these new prices. They still only trade at a 13 P/E ratio and it seems like the market is finally starting to increase these companies' ratios.

----------------------------

**Enphase** **Energy** **(ENPH)**: (41% gain from last post) (83% gain overall)

(7.20% of my renewable portfolio)

--------------------

Since my last post, Enphase has announced several new projects which investors have reacted positively to. Enphase's microinverters will help power projects in Australia, New Hampshire, Mexico and Minneapolis. Furthermore they are increasing production of their IQ7 inverters in Europe and Australia. This international expansion comes as a big plus, because they have a large market share in the United States, but could use some international diversification. 

Overall, it's been only good news from Enphase which has led to a stock price increase. Inverters are a great way to invest in renewables and Enphase is poised to be one of the greatest beneficiaries of the impending solar boom.

------------------------

**TPI** **Composites** **(TPIC)**: (6% gain from last post) (49% gain overall)

(6% of my renewable portfolio)

--------------------

TPIC gets very little news coverage and there's been no recent news. I'd recommended viewing their investor relations presentation and reading my last post. One of their EV partners who I can't name on here or this post will get removed (rhymes with LurkMorse) has expanded production which will benefit TPIC. Also the wind market has seen increased demand in Q3 which will probably be reflected in TPIC's earnings. 

Everything that I said in my last post still stands. TPIC is exciting to me although the low margins are a bit concerning. I think they are a good pure wind investment and there aren't many out there.

----------------------

**Vestas** **Wind** **(VWDRY)**: (18% gain from last post) (122% gain overall)

(5% of my renewable portfolio)

--------------------

Vestas has reported a number of wind turbine sales in countries such as India, Russia, China, Poland, USA, Vietnam, Egypt, Netherlands, Greece, Columbia & more since my last post. They continue to be a consistent beast in the wind market.

If you want to diversify into Wind, this is the company to do it. Their share price has gone up over the last year but I don't see that stopping any time soon.

-------------------

**BrookField** **Renewables** **(BEPC)**: (31% gain from last post) (37% gain overall)

(4% of my renewable portfolio)

-----------------------

The only news out of BrookField Renewables recently is a $325 million secondary offering. They are a dividend play and have historically outperformed the market. Read up on my last post and their IR page for more info but I recommend BEPC if you're risk averse and like dividend stocks. 

-------------------------
**Hannon** **Armstrong** **(HASI)**: (16.40% gain from my last post) (12% gain overall)

(3.90% of my renewable portfolio)

---------------------

HASI is the only new renewable company that I've bought since my last post. They are a REIT and pay out most of their earnings as dividends. Look up their investor presentation if you're interested but they invest in climate change infrastructure, including the land under renewable energy projects. 

I'm inclined to add to my investment in HASI to diversify a bit. Much like BEPC, HASI holds less risk and great dividends.


------------------

**First** **Solar** **(FSLR)**: (5.6% gain from my last post) (33% gain overall)

(3.80% of my portfolio)

---------------------

First Solar also announced a secondary offering to raise capital. Other than that the only news is a new project in Chile. 

First Solar has ran less than the other module manufacturers listed above and remains a dominant player in the U.S. market. I consider them a long term buy and hold at these prices.

------------------------

**SUMMARY**: **155%** **total** **gain** (75% gain excluding Tesla)

We have seen recent stock offerings from several of these companies to raise capital. This to me signals an expectation of increased demand in the future, as this capital will be used to expand production. 

The election and Biden's climate plan is a major factor in why these companies have run so much as of late, but regardless of the election outcome, a renewable energy boom is inevitable. If Trump wins I expect a short-term pullback in several of these companies so look out for that. Either way though these companies are long-term 10 year holds and you shouldn't be concerned with short term swings. Any dip is a buying opportunity unless fundamentals change.

------------------

If you believe that renewables are the future, I highly recommend taking matters into your own hands and investing in these companies or other renewable companies. There are also several great ETFs, TAN is probably my favorite out of these.



**EDIT**: I'll probably make a post breaking down the holdings of the renewable energy ETFs because people seem interested in their differences. Look for that in the next week or so

1682,Investing vs Trading: A reminder of tax implications,609,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i782wm/investing_vs_trading_a_reminder_of_tax/,184,"*TOP EDIT:* This post has gotten a lot more attention than I expected. Due to some critiques posted in this thread, let me preface this post with this statement: Please consult your own personal and trusted tax professional. Don't believe anything you read on the internet without verifying all the information yourself. Tax code in the US is complicated, and this post is primarily US focused. The information in here may be over simplified, but its meant to get people thinking about the implications of various trading activities on their taxable income. Its better to start now thinking about your 2020 tax burden rather than in December when you can't do anything about it.

 = = =

We've seen lots of posts recently from ""new"" investors freaking out over recent dips in the market and deciding whether they should get in or out. This is just a quick little post (and reminder) that anyone buying stocks should remind themselves about the impact of taxes on the trades their making.

Lets take the most recent meme stocks example: FSLY and NET

Lets assume you bought FSLY and NET on July 1 because you felt bullish going into the July 4th weekend. You would have bought Net at $37 and FSLY at $86.50.

Now lets assume that you were smart enough to get out at the peak, which was August 4 for both stocks. FSLY would have sold for $116 and Net for $42.50. That means a 34% gain on FSLY and 15% gain on NET.

But here's something you should ALWAYS think about: if you sell you need to subtract 34% for the tax man since that holding was less than 1 year and it is taxed as income. So your 34% gain on FSLY is actually a 22% gain, and your 15% gain on NET is actually a 10% gain.

Now lets do the numbers:

If you held FSLY for 1 year (until July 1, 2021), you only needed to get it to a price of $105 (not $116) to make the same money. For NET you had to hit a price of $40.70 (not $42.50).

Keep all this in perspective when you look to ""take profits"" or ""should I keep holding my stock"".

Also, this DOES NOT take into effect the reallocation of capital. If you only have $100 to play with, and you bought FSLY at $86.50, holding for 1 year could be opportunity cost on other potential plays. In that case, you probably fucked up in timing your entry and exist. If you only have $100 to play, then what were your objectives on a stock that is already up 400% in 3 months? Did you expect another 100% movement after earnings because you prayed to JPow for more stimulus?

Be realistic and critical about each move. These ""the stock is down, what should I do?"" posts are getting old. Here's a better question that should be posted to this sub: ""The stock is down to X, which is Y times the revenue to market cap ratio. I've done this research to indicate that the company can grow at this rate, which doesn't align to analysts. What are other people's opinion of my research so that I can more accurately assess my own personal price target for this stock I own, or am planning to own"" </rant>


**Edit:** Based on some of the comments below, I think its important we clarify that America has a graduated tax system: https://taxfoundation.org/2019-tax-brackets/

Effective tax rates for someone making $150,000 a year would be around 20% for federal income tax. Beyond that, I think its also important to know that long term capital gains tax is a graduated system where most people would be at 15% step: 
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp

If you're single filing tax payer, and you're making $150,000 a year, then the difference between selling short term and long term is more like 5%. Sell now and realize the gains as income (ie. 20% effective tax rate) or hold and sell later to realize the gains as capital gains (ie. < 15% effective tax rate). The question is, can you reliably put up gains via trading that exceed that 5% buffer. If you cannot, then buy and hold. If you can, then trade!

**Edit2:** In addition to taxes, I think to be a better trader, every person at the end of the year should do a comparison of what every stock they bought/sold would have netted them if they had just bought and held. Obviously, this assumes infinite capital since you can't do any reallocation. But it would be a good exercise! Spend a couple hours calculating how much money you made doing trading, then compare it to if you had just bought a couple of good movement stocks (ie. reliable like AAPL, MSFT, or more volatile like SHOP, SQ, TSLA) and just held them. Replaying trades is important, and understanding the tax implications of each strategy, and then weigh that against how much time and effort it took to trade. If the numbers don't add up, change up your strategy.",2020-08-11 03:28:20
1683,Some interesting news in the stock market this week,607,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/e0fn0i/some_interesting_news_in_the_stock_market_this/,58,"As usual I’ll start off with a high level round up of the large caps before adding a bit more detail on the value and speculative stocks.

**TJX** and **Target** both reported excellent results. However, it was not a good week in general for retail with **Macy’s** reporting a 3.5% drop in same store sales and a data breach. **Kohls** dropped 20% after reporting a miss, cutting guidance and pointing to an “increasingly competitive promotional environment”. 

**Home Depot** results were mixed and the stock price also dropped 10%. A little harsh perhaps after what was a narrow miss and considering comps were still up a very respectable 3.5%. A number of analysts followed the sell off with reassuring comments that the market for home improvement products remained strong with improving home affordability, lower interest rates, aging baby boomers spending money on remodelling and millennials entering the housing market.

Elsewhere, **Snapchat** announced it will be fact-checking all political advertising in a move that offers a middle ground between Facebook and Twitter and may help it take a larger share of political advertising budgets ahead of the 2020 elections. Advertisers will be keen to use Snapchat’s platform which remains highly popular among younger demographics (which are seeing significant increases in voter turnout). With the total spend on political advertising in 2020 estimated at $10 billion even a small share could provide a meaningful boost to Snapchat (TTM revenues $1.54 billion) over the next year.

The man credited with bringing **T-Mobile** back from the dead, CEO John Legere, announced he was moving on and was to be replaced by COO Mike Sievert. The market took the news in its stride, reassured by announcements that there would be no change in strategy and realising perhaps that the time had come for a more conventional approach. Nevertheless Mr Sievert has some big shoes to fill.

**PayPal** said it was putting part of its cash pile to use with a transformative $4 billion acquisition of, discount-finding tool, Honey Science. The stock fell 1.5% but the news was well received by analysts who said it should drive engagement and develop a deeper relationship with consumers and merchants.

Bad news for **Slack Technologies** as a blog post this week by Microsoft Corporation revealed its Microsoft “Teams” service now has more than 20 million users. Teams seems to be gaining momentum, which is clearly a negative for Slack. The latest numbers suggest Teams added 7 million new daily active users in the past five months compared to adding just 1 million new daily active users in the previous 10 months.

Finally the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) released data on Monday, showing a 12% year-over-year declines in appliance shipments. That sounds like bad news for appliance makers such as **Whirlpool** but, as of Friday, the stock was little changed.

&#x200B;

**Value stocks (Fluent Inc)**

**Fluent Inc** jumped 20% after management sent a strong signal to the market. However I think it could go significantly higher. 

The company operates in a fast growing, fast changing and competitive sector - digital marketing. It has built up a huge database of (150 million+) that it can target on behalf of clients. It uses competitions to get details and, importantly, gets consent from clients to contact them.  A former CEO has said that if European data protection laws were introduced in the US it would give Fluent a huge advantage as it (largely) already has consent. Indeed Europe offers a huge potential market for Fluent which has already reportedly started testing in the UK.

However Fluent's stock has not had a good year. The data driven digital marketer is down 75% (with a valuation of 0.5x sales and 0.6x book) from highs after reducing guidance, not once but twice. That by itself is an issue as it suggests that, not only is there a problem but, management dont understand how bad it is.

The overall change in guidance was actually not that bad (not something that suggests a 75% SP drop is required). Full year sales are still forecast to rise 6.4% although EBITDA will drop 34%. Q3 and Q4 numbers are down on 2018 but Q4 still reveals an annualised EBITDA of $20m which compares favorably to the current market cap of $130 million.

I think there is more upside potential. Management have been clear throughout that the outlook for the core advertising platform is very good. The drop in revenues and rising costs are due to the company exiting peripheral ventures that have been explored and not met revenue/return targets (as well as a couple of bad debts deemed unrecoverable). They said they did experience some softness at the core for approximately 60 days, spanning mid-August to mid-October. On the November 11 conference call CEO Ryan Schulke said ""Since mid-October, we have regained our traction and to date, we've seen trending improve from top-line revenue and media margin perspective.""

That has been supported by Tuesdays share buy back announcement with Schulke saying “This stock repurchase program reflects the continued confidence we have in the fundamentals and long-term prospects of our business, further supported by improvements we have seen in our core commercial trending following a challenging third quarter,”

Management clearly want to send out a signal that the core business is improving again and the SP jump of 20% is a good start but it is still down 30% on a week ago and 75% on April highs. (as mentioned above the annualised EBITDA of $20m compares favorably to the current market cap of $130 million)

&#x200B;

**Growth stocks (Target)** 

**Target** reported excellent results as it appears customers warm to the concept of same day pick up from a Target store. More hassle in some ways but it eliminates a load of cardboard boxes that would have to be recycled. Third-quarter results shot past guidance as store traffic and sales growth accelerated. Revenue grew 4.7% to $18.7 billion, beating analyst expectations of $18.5 billion. Adjusted earnings per share rose 25% to $1.36 after the company had forecast EPS between $1.04 and $1.24 three months ago. Stock ended the week up 24%. 25% EPS growth compares favorably to the 20x 2019 PE.

&#x200B;

**Highly Speculative Pharmaceuticals (Karuna, Myovant and Hepion)**

**Karuna Therapeutics** jumped 440% on Monday after reporting a very positive mid-stage clinical trial for its lead candidate, KarXT, for the treatment of acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia

Jeffrey Lieberman, M.D., professor and chairman of the Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons and a member of Karuna’s scientific advisory board said “The results of the Phase 2 trial are impressive and encouraging because they indicate that KarXT, if approved, could represent a game-changing therapeutic advance in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia,”

He added. “The effectiveness of antipsychotics has been limited by the frequent and serious side effects of first- and second-generation drugs which are difficult for many patients to tolerate, are potentially harmful, and lead to high rates of discontinuation and relapse. In addition to its novel mechanism of action, KarXT could be a new therapeutic option that has the potential to offer robust efficacy devoid of weight gain, metabolic effects and extrapyramidal *{involuntary movement}* side effects.” 

The second point is important as KarXT antipsychotic drugs are notorious for negative side effects that often cause patients to discontinue use of the drugs. Karuna reported that discontinuation rates in the study were similar between patients receiving KarXT and those receiving placebo. The company said that there was ""no evidence of somnolence *{drowsiness}*, extrapyramidal side effects or weight gain relative to placebo"" -- all of which are common worrisome side effects of current antipsychotic drugs.

The company also said it planned to explore other CNS disorders that could benefit from the treatment, such as psychosis in Alzheimer’s disease as well as the management of pain

Back of the envelope, I would consider the probability of approval has increased from about 20% to 40% and that the lack of side effects should make it possible for the company to take a 40% share in a $10 billion market. 30% margins with forward PE of 14 seems reasonable.

That would yield a valuation of $6.7 billion (40% x 40% x $10 billion x 30% x 14 = $6.72 billion) compared to yesterday’s close at $1.99 billion. That looks attractive even before considering potential applications for psychosis in Alzheimers or pain management.

&#x200B;

Shares of small-cap biotech **Myovant Sciences Ltd** doubled after Myovant reported on Tuesday that the the Phase 3 study that evaluated once-daily oral relugolix 120mg in men with advanced prostate cancer met the primary efficacy endpoint, as well as six key secondary endpoints.

Now as far as I can see, relugolix faces some competition in its end market meaning its not going to have the market all to itself. One commentator suggested it would win just 5% of the market. I think that is low, men don't like having their testosterone levels suppressed (given the side effects of hot flashes, fatigue and loss of sexual desire and function) and relugolix can help reduce the time patients need to use the therapy.

Data has shown relugolix quickly lowered testosterone to castration levels and the study also showed testosterone levels recovered faster after patients stopped taking relugolix, which could bring benefit for drug holidays or intermittent therapy.

Consequently I think a 10%+ market share along with 85% probability of success, 3 million people in the US with prostate cancer and cost of treatment $4,400 (based on firmagon estimates) then we have a TAM of $1.1 bn (10% x 85% x 3m x cost of treatment $4,400).

With 30% margins and a PE multiple of 10 you get a target valuation of $3.4 billion compared to current market cap of $1.15 billion. I suspect the 30% margin assumption or the 10% market share assumption maybe too high. But even if that is the case, I dont think Myovant's current mcap is expensive.

Stock closed up 128% with market cap of $1.26 billion.

&#x200B;

Now for an off the scale speculative stock. Please exercise extreme caution. New Jersey-based **Hepion Pharmaceuticals** (market cap $12.4 million) reported on Thursday that its CRV431 treatment prevented the development of liver cirrhosis in a highly aggressive, preclinical model of liver disease in an animal study.

""The results align with previous findings in other experimental models and highlight the tremendous potential of CRV431 as a treatment for liver diseases, including NASH, where progression to cirrhosis is a primary medical concern,"" said Hepion CEO Robert Foster.

I’ll just say caveat emptor and it’ll be a great a story if it works out.

&#x200B;

**Insider (Nesco Holdings)**

On Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Lee Jacobson purchased $352,154 worth of Nesco Holdings, picking up the stock after a drop of almost 70% this year. 

Nesco is one of the largest specialty equipment rental providers to the electric utility transmission, telecom and rail industries in North America. It reported mixed Q3 results a couple of weeks ago with revenues down 2.6% and a loss of $18 million but the company generated solid revenue growth in both the equipment rental (up 7.3%) and parts, tools, and accessories businesses (up 51.2%), as well as the 13th consecutive quarter of growth in adjusted EBITDA (up 7.5%).

At the time Lee Jacobson, CEO of Nesco, remarked ""We continue to see considerable opportunities for organic growth, supported by growing customer backlogs within our core electric utility markets, increased market penetration of the rail and telecom markets and further penetration of the parts tools and accessories offering across our existing equipment rental customer base. Shortages for specialty rental equipment in the markets we serve have continued and our customer rental contract periods have lengthened to record levels, further supporting our planned investment in fleet growth.”

That is a very positive outlook from Mr Jacobson and, having almost doubled his shareholding, he has backed that up with his own cash. With the stock trading on 0.6x revenues other investors may also want to have a closer look.

AT&T is a company that I'm sure doesn't need explaining. It is familiar to all of us as a telecom company that has branched out to providing internet, entertainment (HBO Max being one of their more recent ventures), and more.

**Why this is being posted now & the potential:**

* Q3 reporting is set for 22 October.
* At its current price AT&T is in a position to provide significant growth prospects alongside a safe, high-paying dividend.

&#x200B;

Looking at it current chart (16 October for reference) we can clearly see here that the stock is trading at its lowest levels since Q1. This provides a great opportunity to buy quality company at much higher yields to lock in superior long-term returns. It is unlikely they will drop much lower than this point due to the effect downward pressure has on dividend paying companies. If we look at the older charts, when AT&T has reached these lows the stock has a strong tendency to rally from this 27-28$ support area. Additionally AT&T has a lot going for it, let's quickly take a look.

**What AT&T has going for it:**

* It has increased its dividend payout for the last 36 years and has the means to continue to do so.
* Consistent revenue growth.
* Lots and lots of cash on hand.
* They are a leader in the US for 5G.
* They are working to replace old top management (This is particularly important).
* Warner Media and HBO Max

Warner Media and HBO Max may be points of controversy here. Let's look at it from this perspective. These get AT&T into new markets, HBO in particular into the saturated streaming market. Netflix has dominated this particular sector, however Disney and AT&T are cracking Netflix's business model by pulling back their streaming to their own platforms. This is the reason Netflix is creating so many of its own shows/movies and increasing it's subscription price. This pressure is allowing AT&T to slowly claw its way in. (Very slowly though, obv HBO Max is no Disney Plus). Additionally this will be the first full quarter of HBO Max on the books for AT&T, with 36 million new subscribers reported it is likely to have a positive effect on the report.

The safe dividend is a strong factor to remain bullish on AT&T. Even with the disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, AT&T's balance sheets show recurring profitability and consistent cash flow generation can easily cover the quarterly payouts.

**Two big issues:**

* A lot of long-term debt (At extremely low rates, so fortunately it doesn't impact their cash flow too much)
* Terrible acquisitions over the last 10 years (Direct TV, which they are looking to sell)

It could be a good sign that AT&T is finally looking to sell the underperforming Direct TV. Sure they bought it for $67 Billion and would likely sell for $20 Billion but off loading legacy segments can allow them to focus on growth and expand into markets that are actually relevant for today and tomorrow while being less of a drag on their current debt.

**Final Comments:**

Please extend this by doing your own research on top of everything else you have read here, there were many points only briefly touched on.

Thank you for taking the time to read!

EDIT: Thanks to all that posted constructive comments! As several have pointed out, yes, AT&T has underperformed the S&P, it should be avoided if you aren't seeking out a high paying dividend stock.",2020-10-17 12:59:21

# **Stocks are expected to see more wild swings, even if Fed makes big policy move  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/stocks-are-expected-to-see-more-wild-swings-even-if-fed-makes-big-policy-move.html)**
*****
> Now that stocks have entered a bear market, more wild volatility is expected in the week ahead as investors await a big policy move by the Federal Reserve.
*****
> The Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday and is expected by some economists to take its benchmark federal funds target range back to zero, as the economy looks more and more like it could fall into a recession, due to the impact of the coronavirus.
*****
> In the past week, the market was sharply lower but swung wildly in both directions, including the stunning 10% decline in the Dow Thursday, the worst one-day drop since the 1987 market crash followed by Friday’s 9.3% gain, the best day in more than 11 years.
*****
> The S&P 500 ended up 9.3% Friday at 2,711, its best day since Oct. 28, 2008. The S&P is now 20.2% below its February high.
*****
> Strategists say the market purge is not over, though it could be closer to a bottom, with some expecting the S&P 500 to fall through 2,400 before it finds a floor.
*****
> “You could say we’re pricing a garden variety recession,” said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equities strategist at RBC. “We come up with a range of 2,300 to 2,600 as recession territory.” She said the average drop during a recession, since the 1930s, was 32%. The S&P had been as much as 29% off its Feb. 19 high.
*****
> “If [S&P] went below 2,300, it would be telling you the market is pricing in something worse than a recession, In the financial crisis we lost 57% and in the tech bubble, we lost 49%,” said Calvasina.
*****
> The S&P 500 was down 8.9% for the week, its worst loss since the week of Feb. 28.
*****
> “I think we needed to get through this week, in particular — the one where the country went into shut down and now get the second go around of policy response. If they really do bring out the bazookas we should be darn close” to the bottom, said Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research.
*****
> But strategists also point out that the coronavirus is unpredictable and it is hard to say when it will peak, even though many economists expect a bounce back in economic growth by the fourth quarter.
*****
> President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency Friday, which allows him to tap federal agencies to provide emergency funds and other responses to the crisis. The president also announced the government would buy oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and that 1.4 million test kits would be available in the next week.
*****
> Markets will also be looking for further action, which the Trump administration says could include targeted financial aid to industries that are hard hit, like airlines.
*****
> As communities around the country attempt to stop the spread of the virus, the potential hit to the economy grows. Companies have told workers to work from home, universities are shutting campuses, a handful of states closed public schools, and major sporting and other events have been canceled.
*****
> “If it indeed is declared a recession, it will really only be a three-month drop in activity,” said Knapp. “In 2008, the household sector had the highest debt levels it ever had, and the household sector was in no position to respond to stimulus. This is quite different.”
*****
> “We see where are are today is pricing in a recession. It went from a growth scare down to recession territory,” said Calvasina. She said the market is not ready to move higher yet. “I think something else we’ve got to see in addition to extreme panic ratings from the sentiment indicators, we do need to see the news flow get better on the virus.”
*****
> Investors will continue to look for more action from Washington, and in the coming week it will also be the Fed’s policy response that could drive the market.
*****
> “In light of the continued growth in coronavirus cases in the US and globally, the sharp further tightening in financial conditions, and rising risks to the economic outlook, we now expect the FOMC to cut the funds rate 100bp on March 18, a faster return to the crisis-era 0-0.25% rate than under our previous call for two 50bp steps in March and April,” Goldman economists wrote.
*****
> The Fed on Thursday announced a significant increase in funds available for its repo operations, to provide liquidity for the short term funding markets. It also said it would purchase a broad range of Treasury securities, across maturities, with the $60 billion it currently uses to buy Treasury bills on a monthly basis.
*****
> Economists say the Fed could announce other policy moves, like purchases of mortgage securities. Some expect it to return to a “patient” stance, showing a willingness to keep rates extremely low for a long time.
*****
> Analysts have been watching the corporate bond market, where spreads blew out dramatically in the past week, particularly in high yield. Calvasina said she is not yet concerned.
*****
> “We’ve got problems in energy. We have problems in some hospitality related industries. There are pockets of stress, but for me, when I look across most S&P companies’ balance sheets are in really good shape,” Calvasina said. “I don’t think this is a prolonged sort of downturn.”

# Signs Of A Washout?

> The S&P 500 Index’s historic slide continued yesterday, culminating in nearly a 10% loss for the day, and leaving the benchmark index officially in bear market territory, just 16 trading days after setting a record high on February 19. In addition, the S&P 500 has now moved more than 4% each day this week, leaving investors and professionals alike wondering when this volatility could end. While nobody knows for sure, one thing we always look for at market bottoms are signs of extremes, both from a sentiment and price perspective.

> From an anecdotal sentiment perspective, certainly fears of COVID-19 have reached the masses, with travel plans canceled and announcements of major events called off coming nearly every hour. However, investor survey data shows a similar story with the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Investor Sentiment Survey showing the highest percentage of bears since April 2013. In addition, the National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) Exposure Index, which represents the average exposure to US equity markets by the surveyed investment managers, reached its lowest level since September 2015. Following each of those instances, the S&P 500 rallied more than 13% over the next year.

> Another way of gauging sentiment can be from the internals of the market. While the S&P 500 is now well below its 200-day moving average, that doesn’t mean each stock in the index has moved below its respective 200-day moving average. In fact, regardless of the broad market’s trend, when less than 20% of the individual components of the index are trading below their 200-day moving averages, it is considered an extreme. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Thursday’s sell-off left less 6% of the S&P 500 there, a number last seen in March 2009. “These are truly frightening times,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, it is important to remember that the signs of panic we are seeing are typically found at or near major market lows.”

*****

# The Fastest Bear Market Ever

> The historic volatility continues, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average officially setting its fastest move from a new all-time high to a bear market (down 20% from the highs) in the 124-year history of the index. It took only 19 days for this to take place, which is far and away the new record.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-1-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Not to be outdone, the S&P 500 Index is set to close down 20% from all-time highs today, doing this in only 16 days. Again, as of the time we are writing this blog, the S&P 500 is in bear market territory, but there always could be a chance for a late-day rally.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bear-market-2.png?ssl=1))**

> “From major sports postponing their seasons, to travel bans to Europe, the economic impact of the coronavirus is growing exponentially with each passing day,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Markets are pricing in a potential recession and inevitable second quarter slowdown, but it is all about expectations. Should the virus be contained and the worst-case scenarios not materialize, now could be a nice opportunity for longer-term investors.”

> Last, one of Warren Buffett’s most famous quotes is, “Be fearful when others are greedy and be fearful when others are fearful.” We’ve seen many signs of extreme fear the past few days, but the CNN Fear & Greed Index hitting 1 earlier today is quite a historic level of fear. This proprietary indicator looks at multiple inputs (like put/call ratios, momentum, and volatility), but on a scale of 1-100, this morning’s 1 is the lowest level ever seen, besting the 2 it hit at the lows in December 2018. From a contrarian point of view, this could be quite meaningful.

# Perspectives on Waterfall Declines

> Volatile market action over the several weeks warrants some much needed perspective into the history of these types of waterfall declines. Fortunately, we have this research on hand and have been examining the nature of deep, fast selloffs like we have experience here in early 2020 as well as the nature of the inevitable and often sharp recoveries.

> First of all yes, this time is different – and yet it’s not. The headline causes of each of these historic waterfall declines are all different and yet investor, trader and money manager behavior remains rather similar. Fear has once again exposed the market’s overvaluation and weaknesses. This time it’s the fear of the coronavirus pandemic and price war in the oil market that spills over into the rest of the financial.

> Like the previous occurrences of waterfall declines in the table and graphs below the market reacted to fear and sold off fast and hard. It’s too early to tell if this waterfall decline is over or how fast and far the recovery will be. As we continue to analyze the current situation a thorough review of the history of waterfall declines and their subsequent recoveries should provide some much needed perspective.

# Friday 13th, DJIA Attempting to Recover & End Losing Friday Streak

> Friday is a significant day of the week because it is the last day of trading and positions held over the weekend could be at higher risk of an exogenous event or an unanticipated headline. Pages 143 & 144 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020 show the difference in Friday performance during bull and bear markets. Friday’s have been weaker in bear markets.

> However today, on a Friday the 13th of all days, DJIA is fighting to recover some of its losses this week and to end its streak of down Fridays at seven. Down Friday DJIA losing streaks of seven or more, like the current streak, are actually somewhat rare in history. Prior to this year, DJIA has had just six similar or longer down Friday streaks going back to 1950. The last streak of down Fridays was in March and April of 2017. The longest streak lasted nine Fridays beginning on the last Friday of 2000 and lasting into February 2001.

 > In the above chart the 30 trading days before and the 60 trading days after the last six DJIA down Friday losing streaks of seven or more have been plotted to display the average performance before and after the last down Friday of the streak. (There are on average 21 trading days in a typical calendar month) Weakness and lower was the trend during the down Friday streak, but once the streak came to an end, DJIA was higher 60 trading days later.

# Last Stocks Above Their Moving Averages

> The massive declines over the past few weeks have left conditions extremely oversold. As we highlighted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, breadth has been awful while there is no longer a single stock in the S&P 500 that is overbought (1 or more standard deviations above its 50-DMA). In fact, after yesterday's absolute washout, there is only a small handful of stocks that are above their 50 and 200-DMAs. In regards to the 50-DMA, less than 1% of stocks in the S&P 500 are above this average which is the first time that has happened since 2011. The only time in between that saw a similarly weak reading, although not quite hitting that under 1% requirement was back in December of 2018 when 1.19% of stocks were above their 50-DMA. As for the 200-DMA, only 5.59% are above that level. That is the lowest reading since March of 2009.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MAs.png))**

> The average stock is now 26.56% below its 50-day and 24.5% below its 200-day. The table below shows those 22 remaining stocks that are still above their 200-DMAs as of yesterday's close and the few that are also below their 50-DMA. Of these, only Regeneron (REGN), Kroger (KR), Digital Realty Trust (DLR), and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are also above their 50-DMAs. The only other stock in the index that is also above its 50-DMA is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is 11% below its 200-DMA. While these stocks have all held above their long term moving average recently, only GILD and REGN have risen since the index's high on 2/19.

# Selloff Erases All of US Market Cap Gains Since Election Day 2016

> With the US stock market down nearly 7% yet again today, the total market cap of US companies as measured by the Russell 3,000 has fallen $11.5 trillion in less than a month. On February 19th, total US market cap was just over $35 trillion. It's at $23.8 trillion as of this morning.

> What makes this drop even more noteworthy is that $23.8 trillion was the market cap of US companies on Election Day 2016. At this point in time, all of the market cap gains seen since President Trump's election victory have been wiped out.

# Low Rates Send Mortgage Applications Surging

> Coronavirus fears have broadly sent rates lower over the past month. Currently, the national average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stands at 3.68%; just off the low of 3.55% from earlier in the month. With mortgage rates now basically at their lowest levels since late 2016, homeowners have been quickly enticed to jump on these lower rates.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MRNA.png))**

> Last week, weekly mortgage applications from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed a roughly 15% surge as rates were reaching record lows. In the time since then, the Fed's 50 bps cut came into effect and yields fell even further which led mortgage applications this week to surge 55.4%. That is the highest week over week increase in mortgage applications since November of 2008 when they had risen 112.1%. Outside of that period, we've only seen larger weekly increases a few other times since 1990.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/MA-1.png))**

> The spike was driven largely by refinancing applications which rose 78.6% week-over-week. As with the composite, that was the biggest weekly jump in refi applications since the housing bubble. Prior to that, once again you would need to go back to 2001 or the 1990s to find larger weekly increases in mortgage refinance applications.

I normally post in the Options sub-reddit but just like my portfolio that is diversified in 4 stocks, I'm diversifying where I post my plays. This week I have a few positions where I will be buying shares. I thought maybe you guys would like to see my plays.

**Here are the last 3 weeks of returns**

&#x200B;

|**Week**|Buying Power|Profit/Loss|Return|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|$75,000|$4,000|5%|
|2|$79,000|$1,600|2%|
|3|$81,000|$1,500|1.9%|

&#x200B;

**What am I doing?**

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 3 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays & levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

&#x200B;

**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**

**1.** I don't do spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see spreads as a ""Theta Gang"" play and is still very high risk.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

**LULU:** 1x LULU 18 Dec 2020 PUT @ $310 strike. Currently up 45% on the play.

This is holding a lot of my buying power. I'm already up 45% on the play on the run-up it's had so far last week. Waiting for the last 40-50% profit might be laborious since the option will begin to lose theta & delta as the stock price increases. Up 45% in a few days why wait another 2 weeks for the remaining 40%? I will be looking to sell this option once it hits 60% profit or so.

# Chart Rules

**Pink Lines** = Trading range & channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.

**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.

# Master Plays This Week

**FB - Facebook**

Facebook has been on a slow and steady uptrend staying within the pink channel. It's tested support a couple times on weakness and bounced cleanly off them each time. Stock price at $269 (nice) is currently at the lower range of the uptrend channel. I think we'll see some continued momentum upward. If we get another re-test of some lows I think we will find some support at $260 and again at $250. IV is pretty low for facebook, so buying shares and selling weekly covered calls at 0.15 delta for a little extra premium might be better return than put-selling.

**Positions on the watch:**

Dec 18 $260 PUT sold to open. Premium collected: $610, return: 1.5% in 4 weeks.

Break-even price would be if the stock closes below $253.90 by December 18 (currently $270).

OR

100x shares

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**KR - Kroger**

Kroger has always been a boring stock. I've labeled in purple where Buffet announced his stake. The stock shot up after the news and has been range-bound staying between $31-$34 with a slight uptrend. I think KR will react somewhat similar to WMT's stock price with a slow and steady upward grind. If so, we are at the bottom of the channel looking for continued momentum upward. Kroger reports earnings in 2 weeks and might provide a little extra premium on some plays.

**Plays on the watch:**

Dec 11 $31.50 PUT sold to open. Premium Collected: $65, return: 2% in 3 weeks.

OR

IV is low again, so owning some shares and selling CC against might also be a good move.

**MSFT - Microsoft**

Classic Microsoft, not really doing much until it does. This chart only displays the last 6 months, but zooming further out you will see MSFT only goes up, albeit rather slowly. Last 3 months it's been in a slight uptrend bouncing between the $200 and $215/220 levels. Currently at the bottom of the trend channel, and might see some continued momentum going up. Big time support at $200 if we do see a little dip.

**Positions on the watch:**

Dec 18 $200 strike PUT sold to open. Premium Collected: $240, return: 1.2% in 3 weeks.

OR

Buying shares and selling covered calls.

&#x200B;

**NVDA - Nvidia**

I am very bullish on NVDA in long-term. This is another ticker that will benefit as the world shifts even more-so on the tech side of things. They have been server revenue massively and they are no longer just a gaming chip company. Very bullish uptrend even if another round of covid quarantines and lockdowns hit. I think we can see this ticker re-test the $560 level and have another break-out. Otherwise we might see downtrend back to $500 or $510.

**Positions on the watch:**

Options are pretty expensive here. Best play in my opinion is to be purchasing shares outright.

&#x200B;

**SHOP - Shopify**

Shopify has been within the same range since June. A few times it almost broke out of the $100 level, but was pulled right back in. The stock price is sitting at the lower end of the uptrend channel and close to the $1,000 support/resistance. If it breaks through this time look for some confirmation up above and into the $1,100 zone. I do like e-commerce long-term and think SHOP is at the very top of this list when you think e-commerce.

**Positions on the watch:**

Options here are also very expensive, I think I might purchase some shares and look for a quick 3-4% pop this or next week.

(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia plans to boost oil output next month to well above 10 million barrels a day, as the kingdom responds aggressively to the collapse of its OPEC+ alliance with Russia.

The world’s largest oil exporter engaged in an all-out price war on Saturday by slashing pricing for its crude by the most in more than 30 years. State energy giant Saudi Aramco is offering unprecedented discounts in Asia, Europe and the U.S. to entice refiners to use Saudi crude.

At the same time, Saudi Arabia has privately told some market participants it could raise production much higher if needed, even going to a record 12 million barrels a day, according to people familiar with the conversations, who asked not to be named to protect commercial relations.

Stocks accelerated yesterday’s losses as market participants digested a new round of corporate earnings report and the prospects of additional stimulus before the November presidential election.

The Nasdaq finished 0.84% down. The S&P (SPY) fell 0.63%, and the Dow Jones finished the day 0.53% down.

Today, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin admitted that coming to a deal regarding stimulus and advancing the measure through Congress would be “difficult” before the November election. The remarks come shortly after Mnuchin and House Speaker Pelosi met on the phone to negotiate further, a deal Pelosi’s spokesperson called “productive”. The two are set to discuss again tomorrow, but after multiple weeks of discussion and the November election coming ever-nearer, chances for additional stimulus look dim. 

The impasse between US lawmakers over stimulus is alarming, given the frequent calls of Pres. Trump, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members, and economist for more virus-relief. Yesterday, Senate Leader Mitch McConnel said he would introduce a smaller, more targeted proposal to the Senate when the chamber reconvenes next Monday. He said “When the full Senate returns on October 19th, our first order of business will be voting again on targeted relief for American workers, including new funding for the PPP.” The estimated $500 billion deal is way below the $1.8 trillion package proposed by the White House earlier in the week, a sign that negotiations may be souring. However, Pelosi has made it clear she would not support smaller, targeted bills, calling them inadequate. Pres. Trump appears to agree with her, tweeting “Go big or go home!!!” for more stimulus. 

In other news, two companies in the forefront of vaccine development for the coronavirus announced their respective trials were put on trial over safety concerns. Eli Lilly (LLY) said Tuesday afternoon that enrollment for its COVID-19 treatment would be temporarily halted, less than a day after Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) said clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate were paused due to an unexplained illness in a participant. Shares of Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson were little changed overnight after dropping during Tuesday’s session.

In terms of earnings season, all eyes are on big banks as they have already started to report. An article published by Marketbeat summarized sentiment by stating that “JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America saw their profits partly recover in the third quarter from the depths of the coronavirus-caused recession earlier this year. The turnaround stems mostly from improvements in the U.S. economy that allowed these big banks to set aside less money to cover potentially bad loans — $5 billion in the third quarter versus $33 billion in the second quarter.”

1711,Warren Buffett might still be right about the airlines,568,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gxtl7g/warren_buffett_might_still_be_right_about_the/,166,"*""In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but, in the long run, it is a weighing machine"" -Benjamin Graham*

Warren Buffett has taken some heat recently over his decision to sell all of his airline stocks near their lowest point. Amid investor optimism for the return of ""normal"" travel behavior, airline stock prices took flight, so to speak, as a primary beneficiary of this exuberance. This has every investor with a Pied Piper trading account sitting on his couch thinking he is smarter than perhaps the greatest investor of our time. But is he?

* Warren Buffett is not a short-term swing trader, he is a long-term, buy-and-hold investor. He looks at the prospects of a company 20 to 30 years down the road, not 2-3 months
* Airlines represented a significant, but relatively small portion of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Taking a loss on an industry that is in turmoil for the chance to redeploy in another industry with clearer skies ahead is more in line with the investing philosophy that made him a success
* Armchair investors think to themselves, ""Well, people won't stop flying"", I'll buy AAL, UAL, and DAL. While that is certainly true in the broad sense, think about the practical sense. Airlines need to squeeze every dollar out of every flight to remain profitable. Under the ""new normal"", not only might the incredibly important Middle Seat be in jeopardy, but the ridiculously profitable Business Class seat is also going to see massive declines as more and more business is conducted remotely.
* With cash burn rates in the double-digit millions of dollars PER DAY, many major U.S. airlines are only in business due to federal government bailout money -- one of the conditions of which was that they keep paying their employees that are not doing much flying (or revenue generation) these days.
* While it is a near certainty that ""people won't stop flying"", there is no certainty about who will be doing the flying. When the bailout money is gone, the cash is depleted, and the revenues are a fraction of where they need to be, a company goes bankrupt. It is entirely possible that one or even two of the major U.S. airline carriers never get their head above water again. Which ones? (\*Casually glances at American and United\*) I'm not sure, BUT, what I am sure about, is that Warren Buffett has access to way more information about the companies he invests in than you or me.
* Last Thursday, while AAL stock was almost doubling, 14 of its top officers VOLUNTARILY took buyouts to leave the company. Now, ask yourself -- why would anyone in their right mind in a leadership role at a prominent U.S. company with a huge salary and comfy corner office voluntarily leave that company and deny themselves the personal glory of being part of a turnaround story?

**My advice:** Take your profits now and buy yourself something nice -- like stock in a company that actually has massive future growth and profit potential. And do not think that you are smarter than Warren Buffett.

It can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kvs2ow/silver_way_more_than_just_a_precious_metal_and_an/)

In short, there is a massive and growing amount of demand for silver. This is partly due to the fears of inflation and devaluation of the dollar and other fiat currencies around the world, but mostly (60% of it to be exact) comes from industrial usage. People mention, and rightly so, the growing emphasis on solar, electrical vehicles and the computerization of nearly everything. What do all these things have in common? They need silver and substantially more of it the more demand for these products grows.

With demand growing and no way to easily scale up supply (see previous post on why), we are looking at quite and attractive industrial supply/demand story backed up by the fact that it is a precious metal and often moves in tandem with gold.

Now, onto the title, the short interest. We have seen an incredible amount of media attention for what happened to GS and the hedge funds that tried to short the stock, but a somewhat similar case can be made for the silver sector. [This article puts it best.](https://silverseek.com/article/silver-shorts-last-stand)

""The 8 big shorts have been “lucky” so far, that their predicament isn’t widely recognized. I’m sure that a small number of sophisticated investors are aware of the plight of the 8 big shorts. But the simple truth is that there has been no mention of the concentrated short position in COMEX gold and silver futures by any mainstream media source. Even on the Internet, the concentrated short position is hardly mentioned. There seems to be a growing groundswell of opinion that silver is the cheapest asset around (it is) and I’m even starting to hear some ask why silver is so cheap to begin with? Let me make it easy for you – the only reason silver is so cheap is because of the concentrated short position of the 4 biggest traders, who hold more than 312 million ounces short, as of the latest COT report. When combined with the next 4 largest traders, the concentrated short position grows to nearly 404 million ounces. The connection couldn’t be more direct. Silver is the cheapest because its short position is the largest.""

In the debate about of which ETF is the best for our purposes (PSLV or SLV) I think that obviously the choice is SLV. Many people try to discredit it putting in doubt that it holds all the silver that it should, but I think that this has always been biased statements by the bullion dealers. SLV is ran by BlackRock, who have many, many, many more assets under management than the SLV (in fact SLV is one of their smallest funds). Will such a leader of the investment industry put its reputation in risk?

Some years ago (in the darkest recent age of silver, about 2013-2015), the short interest in SLV was much higher than nowadays (about 25-30%). Ted Buttler always defended that shorting the SLV was not permitted by the ETF prospectus itself, because shorting one share inhibits the adding os one Oz of silver (you can sell one share to a new investor without issuing it). He initiated a public campaign against BlackRock by permitting it. The result was a legal threat of BlackRock to Buttler, he had to retreat, but magically the short interest started to decrease during the next weeks/months till ""simbolic"" levels. Even during this last year, where we witnessed silver inflow to the trust of several hundreds Oz Moz over the year before, the short interest of SLV itself didn't rise.

SLV itself has no meaningful short interest itself, but the arbitrage among it and the spot/futures market make the concentrated shorts of the Comex very vulnerable. And remember, the one with the biggest and arguably most corrupt influences, JPM, is no longer in the short side, so it will not be threated and because of that will do nothing, as they only stand to benefit from it.

Advantages of SLV over PSLV are clear:

- Much more available on brokers (unless in Europe due to MiFid II)

- Much more liquid

- And of course, it has options!!


As you can see, what we have here is a combination of an important precious and industrial metal that is being held short to a significant extent, with an extremely attractive supply/demand case for the coming decade to be made as well. Make sure to do your own research on this as well, but in my opinion it is clear that this market is ready to go much higher.

Not even a month and a half ago everyone was talking about a dead cat bounce. Today with 40M+ unemployed, 100k+ dead in the US, an incoming second wave of corona, a massive halt in consumer spendings, China doing China things, you all jumped on the bull train?

I know that investors have nowhere to park their money but isn't it crazy that we are at almost sp500 ATH? Nasdaq is almost there. Russell is on a good path to recovery. The only one is Euro stoxx 50 that more or less reflects what's going on. I know we can't compare this dip to 2008 and that the economy is not the stock market but to celebrate that Disney is reopening its parks or flights to resume? 

Do I live in a crazy world where not even 3 months after a pandemic everything is going back to normal?

1. It **calculates optimal weights for stocks** in a portfolio to **minimise risk** and **maximise return** in the 'Optimisation Tool' sheet, using Markovitz theory, Sharpe ratio maximisation, historical share price data and a few add-ons for Google sheets.
2. It automatically **sends you email alerts** when a stock in your portfolio reaches a certain level of gain/loss.
3. It also has an **automated live 'Portfolio' tracker** sheet with live breakdowns of prices, gains, losses etc. This part is made by u/AnotherDullUsername, please [see their recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/cpu1j7/ive_recently_got_into_stocks_and_created_a/) for more info on how to use this part of the spreadsheet.

**HOW TO USE THE SPREADSHEET:**

The shares in this document are just examples, it is not what I own. Be aware of any possible mistakes the sheet may contain.

**TL;DR:** spreadsheet calculates best weights for stocks in your portfolio to minimise risk and maximise return, also has a live portfolio tracker.

*Edits:*

***Found an error and updated the sheet so recommend redownloading.***

**SOME USEFUL DEFINITIONS**

**Optimal Portfolio:** The portfolio constructed of shares weighted, as calculated by the 'Solver' Google Sheets add-on, to give the most return for the least risk, i.e. the point where the Sharpe ratio is maximised.

**Minimum Variance Portfolio:** the portfolio that bears the least risk given the constrains that the example spreadsheet used in the solver add-on

**Efficient Frontier:**  The efficient frontier is the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return. Portfolios that lie below the efficient frontier are sub-optimal because they do not provide enough return for the level of risk. (The example portfolio used lies below the efficient frontier, see the second graph.)",2019-08-18 01:20:10

1755,Some interesting news in the stock market this week,527,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/e3usjt/some_interesting_news_in_the_stock_market_this/,39,"The week began with **Uber** being banned from the city of London on Monday after a number of safety issues were identified. Uber can continue to operate while it appeals the decision but the move may yet (worryingly) lead to other cities withdrawing its license. Then, on Wednesday, **Deere & Company** revealed a horrendous outlook for construction industry with a 15% drop in sales expected.  However, appropriately for the week of Cyber Friday, it was retail stocks that provided some good news with Burlington Stores, Best Buy and Dick’s Sporting Goods all reporting beats and raising guidance on Tuesday.

**Burlington Stores** showed how “off price” and “treasure hunt” retailers can thrive even while more traditional outlets continue to suffer. In fact they seem to be benefitting from the retail apocalypse as they offer a useful way for producers and brands to offload excess inventory. Expectations were already high but Burlington thrashed them with sales up 8.6%, Q3 EPS of $1.55 smashed consensus forecasts of $1.40 and the company raised full-year 2019 EPS guidance to a range of $7.28 to $7.33 per share from $7.14 to $7.22.

**Best Buy** also reported a significant beat and raised full year EPS guidance to a range of $5.81 to $5.91 from $5.60 to $5.75 (and compared to $5.32 last year).  Some commentators said Best Buy is emerging as the poster child for how to survive and thrive in a post Amazon world. In particular the company announced that it planned to offer next-day delivery on thousands of items, customers will able to pick up products in store within an hour of placing an order and the retailer also launched hundreds of alternative pickup locations in areas where there was no convenient store location.  “We are excited about our holiday plans,” said Corie Barry, newly appointed Best Buy CEO, “Our teams have once again put together a best-in-class assortment, prepared an amazing set of deals and ensured we have great inventory availability.”

**Dick’s Sporting Goods** beat top and bottom estimates and raised guidance for the full year. The company has benefited from strategic initiatives that have focussed on better performing categories, more premium footwear offerings, faster e-commerce delivery times and investment in in-store experiences. Net sales were up 5%, same-store sales were up 6% beating expectations for growth of 2.9% and adjusted EPS was $0.52 compared to consensus forecasts of $0.38. Full year guidance EPS was raised to a range of $3.50 to $3.60 from $3.30 to $3.45 previously and compare to $3.24 last year.

CEO Ed Stack said the company had seen increases in both the average shopping ticket and in the number of transactions during the third quarter and added “as we head into the holiday season, we remain very enthusiastic about our business”.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Growth stocks (Keysight, Nutanix and Ambarella )** 

**Keysight Technologies** delivered a very strong finish to the year on Tuesday with both revenue and earnings exceeding the high-end of guidance for the quarter while full year EPS increased 46% to $4.72. 

Keysight is the leading provider of network test equipment to telecom operators and other OEMs and has benefitted from increasing demand for 5G test equipment. That’s not expected to change with the wireless network test equipment market expected to grow almost 50% by 2023. Additionally it is seen as an agnostic way to benefit from the boom with no single customer making up more than 10% of total revenue.

Ron Nersesian, Chairman and CEO, said on the call this week “we are well-positioned for continued growth with a broad and differentiated portfolio of solutions targeted at the fastest growing segments of our end-markets. Our focus on the long-term secular growth rate trends in 5G, next-generation auto, networking, IoT, and defense modernization give us confidence in our ability to drive above-market growth even in times of macroeconomic uncertainty.”

The stock price took it in its stride, increasing only 1 or 2%, even after Citi said that Keysight remained its top stock pick. Perhaps that is due to weariness given the stock has already climbed almost 90% this year.  However the valuation doesn’t look expensive on 23x trailing earnings with earnings growth of 46% and a very bright medium term outlook.

&#x200B;

There are a couple of reasons why **Nutanix** stock is up 20% since reporting mediocre sales growth and an increase in losses

The cloud computing software company’s move (a couple of years ago) to a software centric rather than hardware centric model has hit the top and the bottom line but the higher margin business looks like it will pay off in the long run.

The market has had a mixed reaction to recent earnings reports but its reaction to this weeks announcement has been well received with the stock up 20%. That’s despite revenue of $314.8 million increasing only marginally from $313.3 million and GAAP net loss per share of $1.21 more than doubling from $0.54 last year. 

That’s probably due to two reasons.

1. Deferred revenue of $975.3 million was up 39%. This relates to the software services which Nutanix has not yet provided. It shows that the new software subscriptions business is growing quickly even though that is not apparent from the total revenue figures.

2. Non-GAAP gross margin of 80.1%, up from 78.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and way ahead of the 62.6% non-GAAP gross margin reported by Nutanix in Q4 of fiscal 2017. That shows that the new software model is way more profitable than the old one.

In short the new business is highly profitable and growing quickly. A good combination. 

The stock is valued at about 5.1x current year revenues which looks reasonable compared to the growth and profitability of the software business. Additionally analysts expect that software sales will start driving top line growth of 27% next year which should allow similar stock price growth even without multiple expansion.

&#x200B;

**Ambarella** was up on Monday after strong results with Q3 revenues increased 18.6% and adjusted EPS of $0.32 compared to $0.21 last year and beat forecasts by about 12 cents. However it was the continuing progress with Computer Vision (CV) that was the real driver of optimism. The results were good but on a valuation of 8x revenues and 90x forecast earnings they need to be.

Ambarella originally rode on the back of GoPro until GoPro faded and Amabarella had to quickly adapt. Investments in 2018 led to CV Becoming the target market with huge opportunities in security and autos. 

It is that optimism that is driving Ambarella’s 57% gains this year. The market cap currently stands at $1.81 billion against a market opportunity estimated at $18 billion and growing by 8% p.a. 

As Fermi Wang, Chief Executive Officer, said in the Q2 conference call

“In summary, we're just starting to realize our vision to enable big data analytics in video HD endpoint devices or AI in the camera. As this play out, we expect to see multi-billion dollar increases in our addressable market.”

That said, there are still plenty of risks with numerous competitors looking to commoditize the business. Additionally trade talks with China could also scupper Amabarella’s vision. 

For me the valuation looks fair, after strong gains this year, a lot of the positive outlook is already built in while downside risks remain significant.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Value stocks (Dycom and Cymabay)**

**Dycom** reported results on Tuesday with revenues up 4.7% while earnings fell 10%. A mixed result perhaps but the drop in earnings was due to a large and complex customer contract previously flagged in other calls that has added to costs and hit gross margins. Encouragingly that troublesome program is now ramping down and will finish by April next year. 

Dycom is the leading provider of specialty contracting services for telecommunications net work operators in the United States.  You have probably seen Dycom's crews working along roadways stringing cable or burying underground fiber. Customers include Verizon at 20.6% of total revenue, CenturyLink at 18.6% of revenue, AT&T at 18.4% of revenue, Comcast 14.9% of revenue and finally Windstream at 4.8% of revenue. 

As a result Dycom has benefitted from strong tailwinds from the huge investment that has gone into connectivity infrastructure. Over the past decade the company has delivered strong long-term growth, including 10% top line growth and double digit EPS gains. That’s not expected to change with 5G deployments driving growth for years to come. 

On the earnings call Steven E. Nielsen, President and Chief Executive Officer, made several encouraging statements. In particular I found this one encouraging, “We believe wireline deployments are the foundational element of what is expected to be a decades long deployment of fully converged wireless/wireline networks that will enable high bandwidth, low latency 5G applications.” 

The stock looks cheap with such a bright outlook for growth and a valuation of just 5.3x current year EBITDA. Profitability metrics have been muddied by the troublesome contract discussed but, with that falling off early next year, profits are forecast to jump 20% and grow 14% p.a. thereafter. That provides an attractive PE of 18x forward earnings.

&#x200B;

**Cymabay Therapeutics** down 70% after it scrapped late stage studies for its experimental drug for multiple liver disease indications. 

It is a disastrous outcome for the company but with a market cap of $121 million compared to cash balances of $219 million, zero debt and total liabilities of $19 million -- it seems there is $79 million of cash that has been completely written off.  In short the stock is valued at 55% of net cash following the drop.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Highly Speculative (Toughbuilt Industries and My Size Inc)**

On Tuesday **ToughBuilt** **Industries** (warning high risk nano cap with market capitalization of just $5.7 million), the designer, manufacturer and distributor of innovative tools and accessories to the building industry, jumped 50% after reporting that its U.S. and Canadian Amazon storefronts had sales in the initial seven months of operation in excess of $1.8 million. Equivalent to an annualized run-rate of $3.5 million, which is 40% higher than the run rate announced in May 2019 by the Company.

That’s a significant amount for a company that reported sales of $15.3 million last year and the market took heart that ToughBuilt could continue to increase sales with a gradual increase of product offerings to the Amazon storefronts and with products also being sold globally on its Amazon storefronts throughout Europe, Australia and other international destinations. 

Encouragingly, Michael Panosian, Chief Executive Officer of ToughBuilt, commented, “The initial seven months of operation of our North American storefronts has well exceeded expectations. In fact, we seem to be on an even greater upward trajectory in the fourth quarter and should continue an annualized basis.”

The stock has since given back a significant portion of those gains but remains up 23%.

&#x200B;

**My Size Inc** (warning high risk nano cap with market capitalization of just $7.2 million) spiked higher on Wednesday (before falling back) after the company reported that it had secured a commercial contract with a leading Turkish apparel company (AY Marka Mağazacılık A.Ş).

It’s the latest in a series of positive announcements for the company since it was awarded a patent last year for its smartphone measurement technology. The company’s app, MySizeID, allows customers to quickly and accurately measure themselves using their smartphone, pick the store or brand they want to shop and then find which sizes fit perfectly. That allows an improved and personalized shopping experience for customers but also allows retailers to save on size related returns which can be material.

Despite the good news, this tiny company is running out of cash and I expect a secondary offering in Q1 next year which will be highly dilutive.  It might be better to wait to see those terms before making a decision on this high risk opportunity.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Insider (Matinas and Assured Guarantee)**

On Monday, both the CFO and Vice Chairman at **Matinas BioPharma** made $100,000+ purchases of stock. Matinas is an interesting company that has a prescription-only omega-3 fatty acid-based composition (similar to Vascepa) under development for reducing triglycerides (named MAT9001). Importantly it has shown superiority versus Amarin's Vascepa for the same indications..

Amarin’s stock has risen 10x over the past year as it has successfully progressed towards approval for Vascepa. Most recently an FDA expert panel unanimously to recommend Amarin's Vascepa for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events including heart attack and stroke.

However back in 2015, Matinas was conducting a phase I trial of its own omega 3 drug MAT9001, comparing it directly with Vascepa. It found that MAT9001 was much more effective than Vascepa at reducing triglycerides and VLDL-C. MAT9001 saw a 33.2% reduction from baseline versus 10.5% for Vascepa, and VLDL-C reduction was at 32.5% versus 8.1% for Vascepa. Despite that trial's success, Matinas put MAT9001 on the backburner while it used its resources to develop its lead antifungal candidate.

The company has since revived MAT9001 with a 100-patient Phase II crossover head-to-head trial against Vascepa on patients with high triglycerides that will begin dosing next quarter, with results expected by the end of 2020.

There is no guarantee that it will succeed and even if it does the approval process will probably take a while. However the results so far are encouraging and the insider purchases send a clear signal that senior management is confident in success. 

The stock price has increased almost 100% but, with a market valuation of just $200 million compared to $7.63 billion for Amarin, there could be a lot more upside for investors who join the CFO and Vice Chairman.

&#x200B;

More insider buying at **Assured Guarantee Ltd** as Chief Investment Officer, Andrew Feldstein, purchase another $1.9 million of stock this week. That brings the total number of purchases over the past 2 months to 20. 

The company is a monoline guarantor that insures municipal and structured debt issuance. It ran into trouble during the great recession but has staged something of a recovery and Mr Feldstein seems to be highly confident in its future.

Two points of interest that caught my eye;

1. The company estimates it’s non GAAP adjusted book value at $90.18 compared to Fridays close at $49.65 (GAAP valuation of $68.94 also compares well)

2. The company CEO said on the Q2 earnings call that he believed the firm had $3.2 billion of excess capital beyond what was required to maintain its AAA rating. A meaningful amount for a company with a market capitalization of $4.7 billion.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Pharmaceutical (Sorrento Therapeutics)**

**Sorrento Therapeutics** up 84% after positive signals from those in the know

Maybe I am reading too much into it but;

\- the company approached a number of potential biotech companies to discuss commercial partnership opportunities

\- it seems that 2 of the companies approached were so impressed that they have submitted bids between $3-$5 which were 88% to 213% above Friday’s close

\- Sorrento have immediately declined the offers saying “the offer significantly undervalued Sorrento and was not in the best interest of the Company's stockholders.""

I am not an expert on the company. I can see it has a number of commercial and late stage non-opioid pain therapies as well as four immuno-oncology (treatments that use the body's immune system to fight cancer) programs in development. Management as usual believe that these have a great outlook for growth. To be fair the non-opioid market is expected to grow from $4 billion to $9 billion over the next 10 years and I have to say it looks like an exciting opportunity for Sorrento with numerous therapies and a market cap of just $480 million (after the recent increase).

However it is the apparent enthusiasm by two unrelated outsiders to make an unsolicited bid having seen (I assume) Sorrento’s plans for development that is key for me. 

The stock is currently valued at $2.92. That is lower than both the rejected bids of $3 and $5, two analyst target prices of $21 and $28 and represents a valuation that is approximately 12% of the fast growing non-opioid therapy target market. 

It is often difficult to judge individuals motivations but when two operators in the sector get inside information and put in a bid at prices above the current price it sends a strong signal that the company is undervalued.

Retail Investors demand more visibility into institutional trading and borrowing. Anyone investing over 1 billion dollars (i.e. hedge funds and other investment institutions) is required to disclose their holdings to promote transparency in our markets - it's called Form 13-F. **But did you know that they only need to disclose it 4 times a year? And did you know its published with a 1 month delay? And did you know that they don't need to disclose all of their positions?**


We the people are asking for a re-evaluation of transparency requirements for Institutional Investors. We have access to technology and data that gives us new sophistication - and are beginning to understand there is a tremendous disparity in access between retail and institutional investors, and are concerned that this access is being used against us, in ways that we genuinely worry could be in flagrant violation of Securities Laws. We believe that with better access to institutional trading data, retail investors can better participate in the market when making buying and selling decisions.


**According to Form 13F (https://www.sec.gov/files/form13f.pdf), Institutional Investors only need to disclose their positions 4 times a year. Why?**


*Filing of Form 13F. A Manager must file a Form 13F report with the Commission within 45 days after the end of each calendar year and each of the first three calendar quarters of each calendar year. As required by Section 13(f)(5) of the Exchange Act, a Manager which is a bank, the deposits of which are insured in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, must file with the appropriate regulatory agency for the bank a copy of every Form 13F report filed with the Commission pursuant to this subsection by or with respect to such bank. Filers who file Form 13F electronically can satisfy their obligation to file with other regulatory agencies by sending (a) a paper copy of the EDGAR filing (provided the Manager removes or blanks out the confidential access codes); (b) the filing in electronic format, if the regulatory agency with which the filing is being made has made provisions to receive filings in electronic format;*


**In your FAQ (https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm), it is clear Institutional Investors are not required to disclose short positions. Why?**


*Question 41
Q: What about short positions?
A: You should not include short positions on Form 13F. You also should not subtract your short position(s) in a security from your long position(s) in that same security; report only the long position.*

AMD is currently sitting at 74.72 pre-market. AMD hit ATH of 94.28 on September 1 before pairing back gains with the entire market.

If you believe in AMD's 3 year plan, getting in at this price may be a good opportunity. The price of AMD hasn't been this lost since July 30 when it broke through the resistance at 60 and then surged to 95 based on big earnings and INTC's poor results.

The entire market seems volatile because of the recent JPow messaging on 0% interest rates through 2023. Its understandable to be skittish.

But as a long term hold, I feel confident that AMD will see the 90's again within 1 year, which makes a nice 1 year hold to benefit from capital gains.

The main risk is the news that broke recently that Sony has cut back production estimates on PS5 due to yield issues with AMD CPUs through manufacturing. We know that AMD uses TSMC to manufacture the chips, but its unclear currently whether this news has widespread impact or what the root cause of the issue was.

10% Earnings growth would require the 5% revenue growth forecast PLUS net margin expansion. However net margins at 11% are already above historic averages (after Trump's tax boost in 2018) and a fall back to 10% averages looks more likely.

Any downward revision would likely have a significant impact on sentiments and valuations.

The last time the stock market valuations traded at this level (with a forward PE of 18.1) was in January 2018 when there was a sharp correction.  On Friday, CNN's Fear and Greed Indexwas at 91 out of 100.  At these levels, it seems likely that the only way is down.

Thats not the end of the world, and nobody can be sure when the correction will come, but investors with shorter investing horizons would be wise to consider a partial pivot into cash or gold.

1767,My company does a stock value guessing game each year. Top comment will be my guess this year.,518,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gvau1j/my_company_does_a_stock_value_guessing_game_each/,159,"My company does a game every year to guess the stock value of our company, here are the hints they give along with the values in previous years, I thought it’d fun to put my guess this year into the hands of reddit. 


Guess the Stock Value

Hint #1-In the last 12 years the share price has never decreased by more than -9.27% (or about $-3.53/share).

Hint #2-In the last 15 years (13/15 times) when adjusted net income went up/down so did the share price. In 2019 Adjusted Net Income went up.

Hint #3-In the last 10 years, when compared to prior year's Revenues (Sales), the share price followed the increase or decrease 50% of the time. Last year revenues increased.

Hint #4- U.S. consumer spending on services, an indicator of telecommunications services sales, rose by 2.2% in October 2019 compared to the same month in 2018. U.S. corporate profits, an indicator of corporate demand for telecommunication services, declined by .8% in the third quarter of 2019 from the year-earlier figure. Total U.S. revenue for telecommunications services increased by .4% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018. Revenue (in current dollars) for the U.S. telecommunications industry is forecast to grow at a compound annual rate of 3% between 2019 and 2023.

Hint #5-(companies name) total asset turnover ratio, which measures the efficiency with which the assets of the Company are utilized, declined throughout the 2015-2019 period, falling from 3.8 times in 2015 to 3.5 times in 2016, 3.3 times in 2017, 2.9 times in 2018, and 2.7 times in 2019, below the period average figure of 3.2 times.

Hint #6-Last year's share price was $60.56

Hint #7- The value of U.S. nonresidential construction spending, a demand indicator for engineering services used in construction, rose by 2.2% year-to-date in October 2019 compared to the year-earlier figure. Total U.S. manufacturers ‘shipments, an indicator of demand for engineering services used in the manufacturing process, grew by 0.8% year-to-date in October 2019 compared to the same month in 2018.

Hint #8-.In 2019 a Segregation Amendment was added to the ESOP. Segregation of accounts occurs when the company buys all or some of the shares of the accounts of participants that have separated service from the company. The cash is invested in other prudent investments until distribution; Segregation of accounts prevents former employees from sharing in future gains (excluding RET, DTH, DIS, etc.); Segregation of accounts protects former employees from sharing in future losses in the value of the company and provides them with additional diversification.; This strategy is used by many ESOP companies to manage their repurchase obligation, enabling them to purchase the shares of terminated participants at the current fair market value. This approach essentially speeds up the repurchase obligation to the time of segregation; Assuming an increasing stock value, this strategy accelerates your repurchase obligation in the short-term and reduces it in the long-term; Segregation can also free up more shares for allocation.

Hint #9-Total Assets increased from the prior year (2018).

Hint #10-Historically if you go with your gut, 60% of the time, it works, every time!-Ron Burgundy (almost)

1768,Some interesting news on value stocks in the stock market this week,519,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hxjkon/some_interesting_news_on_value_stocks_in_the/,73,"It was a big week for companies beating expectations including a number of value stocks, trading on attractive valuations, reporting positive developments.

**Hibbett Inc**, the athletic apparel retailer, $HIBB (trailing PE 10.20) issued outstanding guidance with Q2 sales expected to rise 70%.  Revenues have been boosted by pent up demand, competitor closures and stimulus money. Brick-and-mortar same-store sales are expected to grow 60% and online sales are forecast to jump 200%. Most significant for future growth is Hibbett has been winning new customers with 25% of brick-and-mortar sales and 40% of online sales coming from new shoppers.

Home builder **PulteGroup** $PHM (trailing PE 10.04) reported a remarkable rebound in demand as net new orders increased 50% in June.  Home buyers, typically on higher incomes, appear to be less affected by COVID than the average and lower paid general public and, coupled with a “very limited supply of existing housing stock”, are driving a recovery in the housing market that are boosting home builders.   PulteGroup’s CEO said the recovery in new home demand “was nothing short of outstanding.”  New home construction jumped 17% and builder confidence rose to pre-pandemic levels after plunging in April. 

PulteGroup’s smaller peer **Meritage Homes** $MTH (trailing PE 10.59) reported a much bigger increase with a 32% jump in orders in the second quarter, 78% increase in net earnings, 20% revenue growth and strong margin improvement.   Steven J. Hilton, $MTH chairman and chief executive officer said “Based on our current forecast, we believe we can generate between $4.0-4.3 billion in home closing revenue for the year, including $1.0-1.1 billion for the third quarter, with home closing gross margins around 21% for the third quarter and full year. We estimate that will translate to approximately $8.75-9.25 of diluted earnings per share for the full year,”. **Thats 36% higher than consensus forecasts.**

**Whirlpool** $WHR (trailing PE 12.03) beat expectations with Q2 EPS of $2.15 (compared to estimates for 96 cents) and sales of $4 billion (estimates $3.6 billion).  Both figures were down year-over-year, but the company pointed to “significant Covid-19 related disruptions.”  CEO Marc Bitzer pointed to decisive actions and the resilence of Whirlpool’s business model while CFO Jim Peters highlighted the “solid cost takeout globally and strong cash flow improvement through disciplined working capital management,”.

**Skechers** $SKX (trailing PE 13.44) reported an earnings beat on Thursday and said “Despite the challenges of the second quarter, we are optimistic about the early-stage recovery we are seeing in much of our business, including... the explosive growth of our e-commerce channel,”.  Remarkably the company was able to grow cash balances by more than $175 million during the quarter through working capital and operating expense management.  As a result net cash accounts for about 20% of Skecher’s valuation.

Finally, with **eBay** (2020f PE 15.70) $EBAY due to report Q2 results on Monday,  A Barron’s article said the stock was a buy with analysts (such as Edward Yruma  at KeyBanc Capital Markets) expecting 23% to 26% growth as new sellers, consumer-facing improvements, and new payment options providing long-term tailwinds for the business. ” Yruma thinks eBay has regained lost market share during the Covid-19 pandemic and eventually should grow at rates exceeding overall e-commerce growth “as it both improves its consumer offering and takes advantage of stronger secular trends.” That means, primarily, that marketplace participants are increasingly realizing the importance of selling on multiple platforms.  Trading on just 16x current year estimates, the valuation does look attractive.

Microsoft’s primacy and ubiquity in portfolios reflects the way it exemplifies nearly every characteristic that today’s market is rewarding richly.

Microsoft enjoys mid-30s percent profit margins, has repeatedly reloaded a $40 billion buyback plan and pays out more than $15 billion a year in dividends.

Microsoft is among the top 10 holdings in the most hedge funds, according to Goldman Sachs.

# **Stocks could be stuck in a range until there’s more proof reopenings are reviving the economy  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/stocks-could-be-stuck-in-a-range-until-theres-more-proof-reopenings-are-reviving-the-economy.html)**
*****
> Coming off a volatile week, analysts expect stocks to continue navigating choppy trading as investors try to build a view of what the economy will look like once states reopen.
*****
> Recent data on April employment and consumer spending show the worst declines in post-World War II America. More data in the coming week may reveal how the housing market fared in April, after the economy abruptly fell off a cliff when states shut down their economies in the second half of March.
*****
> Investors’ focus will also be on the government stimulus programs to help the economy and markets get through the coronavirus crisis. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appear before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday, as it reviews the government’s trillions in spending to help the economy, businesses and individuals. An interview with Powell will also air on “60 Minutes” Sunday night.
*****
> Earnings season is winding down but there are a number of reports from major retailers, like Walmart and Target, which should show that the big box stores and discounters are making out better than other retailers as consumers halted many discretionary purchases and moved more shopping online.
*****
> The S&P 500 was down nearly 2.3%, in its worst week since March 20. The S&P ended at 2,863. The Dow was off about 2.6% for the week, in its worst week since April 3. It finished the week at 23,598. The Nasdaq also had its worst week since April 3.
*****
> # Home sweet home
> “Housing is going to be important in that you’ll see the chilling effect that Covid has had on housing as well, less on construction than on sales, but on both,” said Diane Swonk, chef economist at Grant Thornton. “That’s going to be an issue. One of the key things we’re watching going forward is the credit market and housing. There’s been a real tightening of credit because of the servicers.”
*****
> Swonk said the mortgage servicers are caught in the middle between the banks and people who aren’t making their payments. She said it has been impacting lending. “That’s something we cannot afford. Housing was on a tear before, and it has to pull us out of this,” she said.
*****
> Retail sales were down 16.4% in April, and there was an unevenness of performance across the sector. The only positive category was online shopping, up 8.4%. Clothing and accessories, the types of things department stores sell, fell by 78.8% in April. Building materials and garden equipment were down just 3.5%, and that could help Home Depot and Lowe’s which report earnings on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.
*****
> “Market reactions to the data have been somewhat muted,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. He said stocks on Friday were reacting negatively to threats from China that U.S. companies could be targeted if the U.S. does not ease up on Huawei. “The markets right now don’t need another reason to be pessimistic. It seems like both the bond market and stock market are getting a little tired. Both markets are looking for the next catalyst.”
*****
> # Solvency concerns
> The Fed has been given generally high marks for keeping markets liquid, but analysts say they are now more worried about the solvency of companies.
*****
> “There’s an interesting kind of threshold here as we’re approaching three months stay at homes or shelter in place. We’re moving from a liquidity challenge, which the Fed helped us address, to a solvency challenge,” said Michael Arone, chief market strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said unpaid bills start to pile up and default rates rise on credit cards and mortgages.
*****
> “The longer this goes on, the harder for folks to make those payments. That’s why states are eager to open even if it has some risks,” Arone said.
*****
> The Fed on Friday said the pandemic poses severe risks to businesses of all sizes and millions of households. It said there could be a sharp rise in defaults as households struggle to pay bills.
*****
> Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said the Federal Reserve has removed worries about liquidity with its facilities and asset purchases. “The reality is the solvency issue which is the bigger focus of the economy and they go hand in hand with the employment issues as things that have to be addressed at some point,” he said. “Look out over the next two months, the solvency issues are based on how the economy reopens and how that medical progress looks.”
*****
> Emanuel said the Fed’s corporate bond program has helped companies refinance and clean up their balance sheet so if insolvencies become a big problem it would not be until next year. He said how the economy reopens over the next few months will determine what happens.
*****
> “The numbers are out in front of us. We do believe based on what we’re seeing so far, this is the trough of every reading we’re seeing. We do believe things are going to get better. We don’t have reason to believe that’s not the case,” he said.
*****
> Emanuel said the reopenings would be graded as a ‘B’ of ‘B+’ based on how they appear to be going so far, including the infection rates. Nearly all states have resumed some level of activity.
*****
> But the market will continue to be choppy until there is more medical progress, such as a vaccine. In a sense, the market depends on science more than ever, Emanuel said.
*****
> “If all of a sudden, we have a commercially viable vaccine in the first half of next year that’s going to be injected into peoples’ arms prior to, or well before the fall of 2021, then I do think you could make the argument the market is potentially going to hit new all time highs,” Emanuel said.
*****
> # Range bound
> For now though, he sees the market as range bound, and the S&P 500 is currently about in the middle of it.
*****
> “We have been very adamant about the definition of this market as being neither bull nor bear. It’s bounded by the 200-day moving average on the top, which is basically 3,000 and the 200-week moving average on the bottom which is 2,667 right now,” said Emanuel.
*****
> Arone agrees stocks are going to be choppy, and could react to friction. He said one source of friction is the disagreement over state reopenings, between people who want to see a reopening and those that fear a new outbreak. He said there is also friction between Republicans and Democrats.
*****
> “I think until we get clarity that the economy is open and without incident and some of these economic numbers are improving, I think the market is going to remain choppy,” he said.
*****
> Emanuel said it makes sense for the market to remain in a sideways range while different issues are resolved.
*****
> “On a valuation basis, the market is expensive but it’s not so expensive if you assume this economic period is going to be over in a couple of quarters,” Emanuel said. “If you return to growth in the third and fourth quarter which we don’t necessarily know if that’s going to be robust, but we expect it to be better next year.”
*****
> He said he expects a recovery to be more shaped like a bathtub, than like a V or a U, meaning it would be elongated on the bottom before an upturn.
*****
> “Part of what actually supports the market is this abject negativity. When everyone is already pessimistic the presumption is they’ve already done a lot of their selling so there isn’t a ton of fuel for the downside there,” said Emanuel.

# Retail Sales Telling the Economy’s Story

> Retail sales numbers for April were released today, and the basic story was no surprise. Retail sales fell a record 16.4% in April, after declining 8.4% in March, already the largest decline since the government started keeping records in 1992.

> The year-over-year decline of more than -21.6% has already topped the -11.5% seen during depths of the financial crisis, as shown in the accompanying chart. But there are hints that the decline has been heavily influenced by store closures rather than shoppers tightening their belts, and that might bode well for the future as the economy gradually starts to open up.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.15.20-Retail-Sales-Blog-Chart.png?ssl=1))**

> “One of the reasons for the major decline in retail sales is simply because many businesses are closed,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “As the economy slowly opens back up, retail sales should bounce back, as pent-up demand is there”

> For the past two months, the economy experienced an 89% decline in apparel sales and a 59.2% decline in restaurant sales. These numbers capture the effects of businesses closing. The one area of the retail sales numbers that has done relatively well? Groceries had a record April as consumers stocked up and continued to show some strength in May.

> While it will take time for retail sales to get back to normal, several factors are in play that should help support retail activity as the economy opens up. Pent-up demand is increasingly evident. Fiscal stimulus should help preserve incomes. And consumer balance sheets remain relatively healthy, with credit card debt declining the most in decades in March. While weakness will continue, April data may be the low point for retail sales, with good prospects for some strength in the second half of the year. A return to full strength will ultimately depend on the progress doctors and scientists make in limiting the dangers from COVID-19, but even the gradual opening up of the economy may show retail sales numbers starting to stabilize as early as next month.

# How Expensive Are Stocks Right Now?

> As stocks rallied 30% off the March 23 lows and earnings expectations were cut dramatically, valuations have become increasingly concerning for many investors (including some high-profile hedge fund managers being quoted in the financial press).

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the forward (next 12 months) price-to-earnings (PE) multiple for the S&P 500 Index recently eclipsed 20, which is overvalued based on historical averages and at the highest level since the tech bubble in the late 1990s.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.14.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

> While stocks look expensive on this metric—one of the reasons why we expect a correction of perhaps 10% from the April 29 highs—valuations may be getting too much attention.

> “Stocks look overvalued based on earnings estimates for the next year, which will probably fall further,” said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “While the return to 2019’s earnings levels may still be two years or more off, the potential for steady improvement and low interest rates suggest they may not be as stretched as they appear.”

> So how worried should investors be? Here are three reasons not to worry too much:

> * Earnings will eventually come back. This recession has an end date, and eventually we’ll beat this virus. So while earnings will take time to reach last year’s levels, they should steadily improve starting next quarter. A vaccine could accelerate the timetable.
> * Interest rates and inflation are low. A 20 PE with a sub-1% yield on the 10-year Treasury without a whiff of inflation on the horizon is not unreasonable. And Federal Reserve support isn’t going away anytime soon. In such a low-rate environment, the opportunity cost of waiting an extra year for earnings to come through is not high. Most of a stock’s value is derived from the earnings the company could generate in year two and beyond.
> * Valuations are not good short-term timing tools. There is essentially no statistical relationship between PE ratios and subsequent one-year performance for the stock market. Although we expect more volatility as the path of the economy and corporate profits becomes clearer, we also expect stocks to grow into their valuations as earnings likely recover next year.

> Stocks are expensive on traditional PE metrics, and a correction would not surprise us. But given the environment we’re in, valuations are not as worrisome as they may appear. The potential for a steady recovery in earnings over the next couple of years with low interest rates suggests that some of the valuation fears may be exaggerated.

# Why Gold Will Continue To Shine

> Gold has done quite well so far in 2020, up more than 12% year to date versus the S&P 500 Index which is down about 10%. We started to warm to the yellow metal late last year and continue to think it can serve as a potential hedge in a well-diversified portfolio for suitable investors.

> “From COVID-19, to massive monetary stimulus, to historically lower yields, to potentially negative fed funds rates down the road, there are many reasons to think gold could continue its recent strength,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, gold based for years before breaking out last year. This is a strong chart from a technical perspective and eventual new highs over the coming years could be quite likely.

> Initial Weekly Jobless Claims of 3.3 million, 6.9 million, 6.6 million, 5.2 million, 4.4 million, 3.8 million, 3.2 million and 3.0 million the past eight weeks, totaling 36.5 million, is astonishing. The good news is the trend is lower and as we pointed out in mid-April four weeks ago a spike peak in Initial Claims and an immediate precipitous retreat has been an effective indication of a bear market low over the years.

> Today’s chart, presented above, is from the FRED database hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis compares the recent history of Jobless claims with the Wilshire 5000. (Gaps in the Wilshire index line are market holidays.) Clearly, the March 23 low and the spike high in Claims at the end of that week correlate quite well.

# Sentiment Unexpectedly Improves

> The preliminary read on sentiment from the University of Michigan was a surprising bright spot in Friday's weak economic data as the headline reading improved from 71.8 up to 73.7 versus expectations for a decline to 68.0. Even with this increase, sentiment remains near a 10-year low, so it's not as though investors are actually positive, they're just less negative. While the increase in sentiment was a bit of a surprise, it makes sense. April was a month where the economy was essentially shut down, so the impact of that sudden stop on sentiment was intense. However, now that things have started to thaw a little bit, you can't fault people for becoming more optimistic.

> While consumers are feeling a bit better about the way things are, they are still extremely uneasy about the future. The chart below breaks down sentiment towards current conditions and expectations about the future. While the current conditions component showed some improvement, the expectations component saw further declines.

> One question in the monthly survey that caused us to do a double-take was the question that asks, ""During the last few months, have you heard of any favorable or unfavorable changes in business conditions? And what did you hear?"" In this month's survey, the index that tracks instances of unfavorable news mentions hit a record high of 141. This series goes all the way back to 1959, and never before has it been near current levels. The prior high for this index was back in the depths of the financial crisis when the index peaked at 133. There hasn't been much good news lately, but even this reading is extreme.

# Investors Remain On Guard

> In a post earlier today, we noted that individual investors still remain overwhelmingly bearish despite the equity market's rally off the March lows. Another sentiment indicator released by TD Ameritrade supports this view that investors aren't particularly bullish right now. The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index is a proprietary, behavior-based index created by TD Ameritrade designed to indicate the sentiment of individual investors’ portfolios. It measures what investors are actually doing, and how they are actually positioned in the markets.

> The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index has been in existence since 2010, and in that entire history there have only been five months where the index was weaker than it is now, and that was from October 2011 through February 2012. That was also a period that marked a major low in the equity market and was followed by a nearly uninterrupted three-year rally in the S&P 500.

> While the Investor Movement Index is near record lows right now, it has been weak for some time, and that weakness came even as the S&P 500 was climbing to record highs over the last 12-18 months. In other words, while investors are just about as cautious as they have been at any time in the last ten years, this conservatism is nothing new.

1776,"Packaging Deep Dive- the new battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC",510,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/it7nbn/packaging_deep_dive_the_new_battleground_between/,72," This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my [blog](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=r%2Finvesting) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i73sw1/deep_dive_into_the_reasons_behind_why_intel_is/),  you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom  for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case.  Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly  important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated  circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been  overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the  calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside  world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of  fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies,  which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and  lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the  package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over  the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging,  not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the  falling benefits of moving to smaller processes \[1\], coupled with  rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can  cost up to $125million \[2\], while the R&D costs to make smaller  processes are also increasing \[3\].

What is packaging?

The  best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of  architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker.  Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making  the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first  hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at  the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces  (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the  traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the  traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building  and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go  about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking\[4\]. In the terminology of our  analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office  building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team  can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut  costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular  department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use  identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a  ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure  that communication flows easily and quickly between each different  office building.

3D stacking is  like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer  chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing)  to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies  on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing  life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer  rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat)  escape.

Chiplets

Chiplets  are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re  commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The  most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in  AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the  chips you want to connect.\[5\] This interposer acts as a conduit between  the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as  having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you  had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient  (PCB traces).  AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss  later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s  CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation,  the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips  (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). \[6\]The  second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are  exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete  floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead.  \[7\]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only  connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to  get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you  would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have  to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete  foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really,  this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s  HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source  interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors.  Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to  be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made  it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an  attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences  inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which  approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s  evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it –  Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers  working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product,  to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them  to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across  many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s  own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between  different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete  foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect  their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which  is impossible with Intel. \[8\] At the same time, it could also be used  by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive  impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just  like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the  massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing  costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market.

Chiplets  are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel,  expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next  few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing  philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be  fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can  improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear,  EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads,  while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for  the next two years at the very least.

3D stacking

In  theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on  top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges  are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately.

3D  stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite  the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 \[9\],  Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago \[10\], and  TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago \[11\], the  reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained  earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the  heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made  by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large  amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D  stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like  mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking  forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book,  to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical  footprint.\[12\] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on  top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have  been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far  behind.\[13\] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the  high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved  the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling  issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred  through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). \[14\] These  are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data.  Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the  connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can  technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is  slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), \[11\] the  issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in  datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat.  AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of  how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, \[15\]while Intel’s  Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. \[16\] When you consider the fact that all  this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent  that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current  techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip  conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past  the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before  we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a  paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in  efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip  better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be  tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip,  making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as  is the case with current designs. \[17\] Obviously, this is completely  uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with  current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die  and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance  Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of  a logic die. \[10\] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of  in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic  dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic –  and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to  various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip  horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away  that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the  intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the  opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the  reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in  the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall  leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly  effective, both in cost and performance.

After  reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you  why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the  opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future  is promising is threefold.

1. Packaging  is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind  now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in  process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very  start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big  strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering  prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in  lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the  battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that  integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic,  unified approach to designing a chip proving useful.
2. Intel  spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in  2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%).  \[18\]\[19\] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in  anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely  that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of  competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be  some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a  function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based.
3. Intel’s  (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it  to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down  for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay  his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best  person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be  constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the  internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening  up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a  comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors.

If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak.

Semiconductors  are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such  huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for  shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the  technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing  style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in,  and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical  aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as  well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly  throws at us.

I plan on buying 100 DIS, 100 BA, 100 MSFT, 100 APPL, 100 TSLA (if it drops to $400/share again.)

“When a individual with cash meets an experienced individual, that individual with experience ends up with cash and that individual with cash leaves with experience.“.This was Warren Buffett’s response, when asked about his best investment advice. Warren Buffett says that experience is the ultimate key to be a successful investor.

One of Buffett’s most famous quotes is “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.”

Warren Buffett is considered to be one of the best long-term investor, so it’s no wonder many people like to listen closely to Buffett’s words of wisdom, in order to apply them to their own lives. With that in mind, here are Warren Buffett’s Investment Tips

Warren Buffett’s Investment Tips

Investing is long term Game

Money doesn’t grow overnight, by getting nine women pregnant you can’t make a child in a month. No matter how good the talent or attempts are, Warren Buffett is just saying some things take time.

Investment planning should be done by considering long term goal. Investor goes for futures and options with the hope of making quick money but they are actually the one who loses more money.

Warren Buffett never did trading (Intraday or Positional). Warren Buffett also says “If you aren’t willing to own a stock for 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for ten minutes.”

Diversification isn’t always a good idea

Many good investors says diversification is good idea for investment in stock market. But Warren Buffett tends to disagree with the idea.

Warren Buffett suggests diversification is for individuals who have little knowledge of investment. An experienced investor should select long-term stocks and have confidence in their investments.

“Diversification is a protection against ignorance. It makes very little sense for those who know what they’re doing.” – Warren Buffett

Some investors diversify their portfolios because they are afraid that any one stock might sink their entire portfolio; but, while doing so, it becomes much harder to keep focus on individual investments. They may decrease their portfolio’s volatility by diversifying, but at the same moment decrease their focus on individual investments.

Excessive diversification also means that a portfolio is likely invested in a number of businesses, diluting the impact from its high quality holdings.

“The idea of excessive diversification is madness.” – Charlie Munger

Don’t invest in a company whose business you don’t understand

This is one of the most important Warren Buffett’s Investment Tips. People invest their hard earn money just by hearing something good about the particular company from others. You can determine if there will be any related economic issues in the future by knowing the company. In the stock market, there are many firms whose company can be understood by any ordinary individual. Buffett warns you should never invest in companies you don’t comprehend completely.

Trust yourself to be a successful investor

Warren Buffett says that the hardest thing is to trust your investment decisions. You always think that others are right and you are wrong. Instead, you need to study and believe in yourself.

“I always knew I was going to be reach. I don’t think I doubted for a minute”- Warren Buffett

To be successful, you need to overcome the fear and not pay attention to what others are telling you. Accumulate understanding and create investment choices to stand apart from the crown and be a winner on your own.

Think like an owner

Warren Buffett always says in his interview, you have to thinking like an owner changes your whole views on stock investing.  Warren Buffett says if you are going to own a new car/bike, you will think about its fair valuation, you will think about its features and you will compare it with cars/bike offered by other manufacturers from the same segment. Then you’ll decide which one to purchase after reviewing everything. Similarly, stocks should have the same view.

Prefer quality stocks than cheap stocks

A lot of people buy stocks just because they are cheap without understanding that cheap is not always better. Charlie Munger’s Buffett discovered that “buying a great company at a fair price is far better than buying a fair company at a great cost.” Chances of losing money in cheap stocks are very high compared to investment in a fairly valued stock

There’s no room to be emotional

“Some individuals are not supposed to own stocks at all because they are too annoyed by price changes. If you’re going to do stupid things because your inventory is going down, you shouldn’t own a stock at all, “Warren Buffett said during a cnbc interview. Some people aren’t really mentally or psychologically fit for their own stock, but I believe more of them would be,” Buffett said if they were more informed about what they’re actually purchasing, which is component of a company

PricetoEarningsRatio(P/E)
• Use within same sector to compare companies, compare it to the average PE of the sector

• “What you pay for 1$ of company earnings”

• Want the PE BELOW sector average.

PricetoBookRatio(P/B) • If the PB is less or equal to 1 (1>x), the stock is trading at/below the value of its assets.
• If the PB is greater than or equal to 1 (1<x), the stock is trading at/above the value of its assets.

• Use this to compare companies within the same sector

• Current share value ($) / (equity/share)

PricetoEarningstoGrowth(PEG)
• Good to use on a company with rapid growth

• If PEG is less than or equal to 1 (1>x), company is undervalued.

• If PEG is greater than or equal to 1 (1<x), the company might be overvalued.

ReturnofEquity(ROE)
• “how well a company generates earnings”

• 17-20% = very good

• 20-25% = excellent

• 25%+ = superior

DebttoEquityRatio
• Try to avoid companies that have a ratio greater than 2.

CurrentRatio
• “the ability to pay short term and long term debt”

• x>1 = liability > assets

• x<1 = liability < assets

• x>3 = holding back

SECFilings
• File 4 = acquired/disposed of shares by insiders

• File 8/10K, looking for management optimistic/bullish

Financials

IncomeStatement(Revenues&Expenses,P&L)
• Revenue = driven by price and quantity of the product sold.

• Costs of goods sold = price of labor, materials, etc.

• General and Administrative Costs = price of sales people, utilities or rent).

• that takes you down to operating profit or EBIT

• from there you subtract out your interest expenses (amount of interest you pay for debt) and your taxes (companies have an effective tax rate) to get to your 'Net Income'

• Financial institutions like to look at a metric called EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization) which is a semi proxy for free cash flow

• its essentially your operating earnings adding back Depreciation and Amortization which are non cash expenses

• Depreciation (think of buildings, you have a building worth $100 and you depreciate it over 5 years so goes down by $20 every year but its not a true expense so you add it back

• Amortization is for intangibles think like Intellectual Property

BalanceSheet(Financial position at a given point in time)

• Balance Sheet (financial position at point in time). Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity

• That's the very definition

• On the Assets side, you have Cash and equivalents (could be short-term treasuries that you can convert to cash pretty quickly usually within a year), Accounts Receivable (what a client owes you in credit), Inventory, PP&E (think like machinery for industrial companies). Liabilities is primarily A/P (what you owe ), Debt, both short and long term among others

• then Owner's equity is Common Stock, Retained Earnings (Net Income - Dividends paid to date) flows from Net Income on income statement

CashFlowStatement(cashflowfromoperations,financingand operations)

• Cash Flow Statement, 3 main ones are Cash Flow from Operations (pretty straightforward what this means, day-to-day cash outflows/inflows)

• Cash Flow from Investing (CapEX is the big one here, represents purchase and sale of equipment, plant, properties, etc.) also outflows from acquisitions or inflows from sales show up here • Cash Flow from Financing is how the company raises money, you issue stock, you issue debt, and you get money

• companies can also repurchase their stock to lower number of shares outstanding, shows confidence in the stock",2018-07-16 15:03:32

This Week Stock Earnings Reports [12-14],493,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kcwwq9/stock_market_news_santa_claus_stock_effect_up/,92,"**Are stocks going to benefit from the Santa Claus effect this year? What’s the latest news in the stock market? This week earnings reports & more**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday, as we saw the [DOW](https://ibb.co/XF2RH8q) finish in the green up .16% but closed the week down 0.57%, while both the [SP500](https://ibb.co/CBm2qZQ) which lost .13% on Friday and .96% for the week and the [NADSAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/RbY68rn) also down .23% on Friday and 0.69% for the week struggled to recover after a very bad start to the trading day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/C68dbNJ) finishing the week at a new high, over the 23 levels, as the volatility index has seen a spike of over 12% in the last [week](https://ibb.co/0F78Vtm).

You can see that a big majority of the companies were on the decline on [Friday](https://ibb.co/NCBm6Bg), with low volumes, as only around 10B shares traded hands compared to 11.5B shares in the last 20 trading days, as some profit-taking combined with some healthy corrections in stocks have moved the markets slightly lower.

On a factor [basis](https://ibb.co/k1HTXfs), value plays suffered on Friday, especially small and mid-caps, while growth was pretty flat, with only Energy and Financials lost more than 1% on Friday, as Energy was the only [sector](https://ibb.co/ynW3BzJ) to finish in the green this week, up 1,21%, while Real Estate lost almost 3% and Financials also lost almost 2% in the past week.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/cNCSPHk) from Friday, not a lot of green to be seen, with the exception of Microsoft, Disney and Toyota.

While for the week, pretty much the same can be seen in the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/rfcfdL6), as Disney, AT&T, Elly Lilly and Toyota were the only big gainers.

[Here](https://ibb.co/fXLgKLc) is the most interesting economic data coming out this week with Wednesday and Thursday being the biggest ones, as we get a better read on what the economy is doing, while also getting the Federal Reserve latest and last decisions for this year.

[Today](https://ibb.co/M9GFCFf) we get the electoral college across state capitols formally casting their votes, while On Thursday we also get the Moderna vaccine FDA Ad Com voting process and results.

The Fed doesn’t really have many [options](https://ibb.co/p44t6C0) at the moment, but they can still move to buy longer-term bonds or decide to buy even more than the current monthly allocated program. The Fed is not expected to cut the benchmark rates anymore, as they are already near 0.

So, I think we might start to see some of the Santa Claus [effect](https://ibb.co/1KF6gJC) starting very soon, probably sometime between this week and the middle of next week, as you can see in this chart, the SP500 has posted very good returns in the past 70years on average in this period, but yeah, who knows after what has happened this year.

Also, you can see in this [chart](https://ibb.co/2YMgNSK), that the big tech stocks have underperformed the market since the start of September, as small caps have outperformed, I think we might finally see some of the big tech names start to gain some momentum once again, especially Apple & Amazon.

I think this might happen as more of the big cash flows that are sitting on the [sidelines](https://ibb.co/8dpv9gd), might finally start to be move to the stock market.

While on Friday we saw the consumer [sentiment](https://ibb.co/Vpc4Hfs) jumping more than expected, but is still way [down](https://ibb.co/5FTD721) from a year ago. We also got the producer price [index](https://ibb.co/jDTTkgb) for November which rose by .1% and is up .8% year over year, more than expected.

[Here](https://ibb.co/hLkWLYz) are the most interesting earnings report for next week, I am especially interested to see what Jabil, FedEx, Nike (Friday) and Blackberry report.

I think we can see great number from Jabil which will benefit from the iPhone 12 sales, while FedEx, the largest parcel delivery service in the world is on watch, as they are considered a proxy for the global economy. With Nike also expected to report strong numbers with an increasing number of physical stores re-opening and a strong boom in direct-to-consumer business.

Guys, [Disney](https://ibb.co/xfB6Qxz) saw a huge pop in the stock after a great investor day, but i won't go into more details as i have previously posted about them.

I also wanted to mention this, but I guess you already know this by now, the [FDA](https://ibb.co/8rPL1q2) gave the green light very late on Friday while the [CDC](https://ibb.co/kMkxfFf) also formally signed off in the weekend.

The first deliveries of vaccines are expected to reach more than 150 state locations [today](https://ibb.co/D9XjNyR) with another 450 locations in the next couple of days as the vaccine began to be packaged and shipped on [Sunday](https://ibb.co/84mzTwG) morning. So yeah, I guess we can keep the tradition of Vaccine Monday going. If both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will be available, with the US just exercising the [option](https://ibb.co/QkCFhW6) to buy another 100M doses from Moderna, the US is aiming to vaccinate 20M this month, 30M in January and another 50M in February, that would bring the total to over 100M people.

[Walmart](https://ibb.co/n6wJKvx) has started to mobilize to help with the distribution, while [CVS](https://ibb.co/qkWYTJx) also has plans to begin vaccinations starting next Monday.

Guys, just wanted to mention that I came across this [tweet](https://ibb.co/K5fsgxN), I think it pretty much sums up the latest IPO frenzy that we had with [Doordash](https://ibb.co/Rzq7g9F) and AirBnB, with both in my opinion starting trading at insane valuations, that aren’t really justifiable.

The big IPOs this week, had a big influence on the markets, as investors probably had to sell a lot of stuff to buy into DASH & AirBNB, this might have led to an imbalance in the markets. As people who used market orders were forced to sell stuff to fund the buying of these 2 highly overvalued stocks in my opinion.

Just look at this [chart](https://ibb.co/9VpnfS7), as the average first-day return for IPOs has seen a huge spike in the last year, with an average of 37% first day return this year. But, just look at the % of [IPOs](https://ibb.co/V339X8N) with negative earnings also increasing since 2010, that just doesn’t seem to bother investors, as they are looking for fast growing companies that don’t emphasize earnings.

Just a fact, [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/S3QFQ64) became only the 3rd tech company to open with a market cap over $100B, the only others ones being Alibaba and Facebook.

After this 2 crazy IPOs some of the next [companies](https://ibb.co/J5BRZ8f) that planned to start trading last week, Affirm and Roblox, delayed the plans, as this companies seek to determine the right price for the shares and the right company valuation with advisors, so they don’t leave money on the table like AirBnB and Doordash have done last week.

My opinion is that if you don’t like these high-flying IPOs, don’t short them, just avoid them and buy stocks that you really like and expect to have great growth

We also saw a [report](https://ibb.co/86vpGyP) from The Information, which is not actually doing any reporting of any specific deals, that presented their next logical M&A deals, this led to the [stock](https://ibb.co/D1VGXwj) of Dropbox to spike almost 14% including after-hours trading and [MongoDB](https://ibb.co/mHPQw0L) to gain more than 6% on Friday.

Other [news](https://ibb.co/5GJBH1w) came for videogames and video gaming consoles which saw a record $7B in sales, over 35% more than last year, bringing the total to over $44B for the year, with more than $1.4B spent on news consoles from Sony and Microsoft just in November.

While in the EU, [Brexit](https://ibb.co/YPQRhqv) talks keep getting extended time and time again as the EU and Great Britain still are trying to figure out some sort of a deal.

We also found out what companies are getting [kicked](https://ibb.co/4Y74VFQ) out of the SP due to the inclusion of Tesla and that the latest [shutdowns](https://ibb.co/C5116dp) for the holidays have been extended more than usual.

Let’s hope for a great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/Zzf0FVN) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.

1797,Manual on reading financials,495,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g4tw2a/manual_on_reading_financials/,45,"After my last few big posts, I noticed a lot of you want to learn financials, so I'll share my way of working and reading financials. There are way more ways to read companies, but I think this is a decent, bit extensive way to read basics. 

You can choose how far you want to dig into financials, however it's beneficial to consider all measures. It gives you the best understanding of companies and the difference amongst the industries. 

**BALANCE SHEET**

Assets to liabilities is the most important part. It should be x1.5 at least to be safe, however there are exceptions. Banks for example will operate around x1.1-1.2, while Biotech exceeds x3-4 easily for most of them. 

Next up is cash and long term debt. I'm working with tech companies the most and cash has to exceed long term debt before I add them to my watchlist. Extra points for those who can exceed all liabilities as well. This is again highly depending on industry. You can't expect those measures from companies working with estate, loans, etc. 

Similar to these measure are cash-to-debt and debt-to-EBITDA ratios. Speaks for itself, cash-to-debt exceeding 1 is very good, debt-to-EBITDA below 1 is very good. EBITDA means earnings before interests, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

**INCOME / PROFITABILITY**

Looking at revenue and expense. You can go back as far as you like. I personally don't look beyond 5 years. With these numbers, I calculate profit margin and revenue/expense growth.

Profit margin is depending on industry and growth. If a company isn't making money, doesn't mean it's bad. Great companies like Tesla aren't profitable yet, but will be soon. The most important part is the balance sheet to be financially healthy. 

When looking at revenue/expense growth, I like to compare percentage over 3 and 5 years. That way you'll see if a company is growing faster or slowing down in the last years. It isn't an important measure, but I'll look at it when deciding between multiple great companies.

**VALUE**

To calculate value, the most common way is to look at PE ratio. You take share price divided by earnings per share (EPS). 20 PE is seen as standard fair value, however it's heavily depending on growth and industry. It's important to look at industry average as well. For example, the Oil & Gas industry is more conservative and has an average of only 8.33. Industries with more growth potential will go over 20. 

To get a better view on growth value of a company, we look at PEG ratio. You take PE ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings for a specified time period. In general, 1 is taken as ""fair future value"". Like PE, this is also depending on industry average, so check this as well. To give an example, RTX has 1.56 PEG. This wouldn't be ideal, however Defense industry average is 1.75, therefore a good value buy. 

**DIVIDEND**

Of course you look at dividend yield first. It's the yearly amount you get per share when they pay out dividends. Most of the time, it's a counter to growth. Industries like Real Estate have an average of 6.84%, but you won't see your shares grow as they do in let's say the Tech industry. You can ask yourself whether you value growth share gains more than stable dividend income. Be cautious in times like these, cause a lot of companies will cut their dividends to pay debts. 

Nice to look at as well is payout ratio. That's the percentage on how much the company is paying dividend from their profit. Let's say a company has an 0.1 payout ratio, meaning it's holding out on 90% of their profit. They could invest it again to grow, keep it in cash to increase financial stability or you could look at it like there's a lot of room for that dividend to grow over the years. 

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

Definitely read about your companies as well. Financials are important, but also know what your company is working on. Where are they expanding, are they working on something new that would get your share up in the future, was there any negative news about them,...

That's about it. Most important, always look at industries, because there are big differences. Hopefully it helped and maybe inspired you guys/girls to dig deeper into your favorite companies. I mostly use Macrotrends for raw financial numbers and Gurufocus on ratios, so I don't need to calculate all of them myself, saving me a bit of time.",2020-04-21 01:34:48

1804,The GOAT Hedge Fund: Renaissance Technologies,489,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/f1o73u/the_goat_hedge_fund_renaissance_technologies/,150,"Renaissance Technologies is the Greatest Hedge Fund of All Time.

Founded by math genius Jim Simons, it's flagship fund Medallion has an average annual gross return of 66.1% since 1988.

With an average annual net return of 39.1% after fees.

The Medallion Fund is available only to current and past employees and their families, closing to outside investors in 1993.

Since, 1988, the Medallion Fund has racked up trading profits of more than $100 billion.

Now, I mentioned a net return of 39.1% after fees: well, the fees have been greater than the usual '2 and 20' structure (which means a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee).

Medallion has had a 5% management fee, and from 1988 to 2001, a 20% performance fee and from 2002 until now, a 44% performance fee.

Notice in particular the return in 2007 and 2008, a time when many were completely REKT.

In 2008, a return (after these monstrous fees) of 82.4%

**To make us all feel terrible, if you had invested $1000 into Medallion in 1988 you would have today, after fees, around $23MM**.

That certainly beats inflation...

So, how did they do it and what can we take away from this story (aside from searing jealousy)?

**PART 1: The Early Stages**

Remember, this was the late 1980s before the phrase big data became a household name and most investment decisions were made over the phone based on gut with the likes of Jordan Belfort trying to scam you!

“I don’t want to have to worry about the market every minute. I want models that will make money while I sleep,” Simons said. “A pure system without humans interfering.”

Simons hired Sandor Straus to help him collect historic commodity information

Straus’ was essential to Renaissance Technologies early success in commodities trading.

He became somewhat of a data guru ensuring pricing was consistent and accurate, checking his numbers matched with yearbook data provided by commodity exchanges, Wall Street Journal, other newspapers and anything else he could get his hands on.

Over time, Straus and his colleagues discovered additional historical pricing data, helping the development of new predictive models.

In fact, some of the stock market data they'd later find went back as far as the 1800s!

At the time, the team couldn't do much with the data, BUT the ability to search modern history to see how markets reacted to unusual events would later help Simon's team build models to profit from market collapses and so called 'Black Swan events'.

The return in 2008 is a prime example of that.

Commodity markets were relatively simple and RenTec found success in deploying simple trading strategies.

The fund wasn't bothered as to why these trading patterns existed - the only thing that mattered is that they occurred in a predictable and actionable way.

**PART 2: Intellectual Capital**

Now in order to build these quantitative models, RenTec is composed of mathematicians and physicists of the highest order and it has even been described as the ""best math department in the world"".

Therefore, their quantitative researchers are well aware of the problems with data mining, over-fitting and spurious signals.

We are taking A LOT of data: 9TB per day in fact.

RenTec originally focussed on trading commodities, currencies and futures.

The strategies were mainly trending (i.e. price will continue to move in same direction) and mean reversion (i.e. price will return to original value).

Simons was experimenting in the stock market (equities) since the late 1980s but the strategy that had worked well on futures was not working on equities.

In 1995, David Magerman, an early employee, spotted a line of simulation code used for the equity trading system showing the S&P 500 at an unusually low level.

This test code appeared to use a figure from back in 1991 that was roughly half the current number.

It had been written as a static figure, rather than as a variable that updated with each move in the market.

Magerman also spotted an algebraic error elsewhere in the code.

Finally, the simulator’s algorithms could finally recommend an ideal portfolio for the trading system to execute.

The resulting portfolio seemed to generate big profits, at least according to Magerman’s calculations.

Only then did Renaissance commit significant capital into the equity markets, and since then...well, pretty good....

**PART 3: Infrastructure**

Now I mentioned before about the sheer amount of data RenTec is utilising.

Big data has obviously caught on, but many hedge funds continue to under-perform the market and even some hedge funds focussed on quant methods haven't fared too well.

The problem, and one of the reasons RenTec is so special, is the barrier to entry is so incredibly high:

Building a data pipeline and the infrastructure required to process that data is no trivial matter.

To then get profitable trading signals from that processed data is a mammoth task.

RenTec has been in the game for over 30 years, constantly refining their algorithms and improving the efficiency of their data processing pipeline.

They have completely automated the process of signal discovery:

They don't hire researchers to manually derive novel insights or trading models from data, and they don't really bother with exclusive sources of data. Instead, they hire researchers to improve methods for automatically processing vast amounts of arbitrary data and extracting profitable trading signals from it.

RenTec has automated the data processing and feature extraction pipeline end to end.

The data is a pure abstraction to them. They don't bother with forming hypotheses and trying to find data to test them, they allow their algorithms to actively discover new correlations from the ground up. So many quantitative funds advertise how much data they work with, and how they have all these exotic sources of data at their disposal - but the data does not matter. The models for the data do not matter.

The mathematics of *efficiently processing* that data are what matters.

**CONCLUSION:**

**The takeaway from this is the following: do not day trade, you will get REKT.**

**You are competing with immense infrastructure and intellectual capital of the highest level.**",2020-02-10 20:57:29

Lemonade has a wild ride, while NIO shines again. Is JNJ the best vaccine play? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market giving up some of the last week gains, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/XXF9JHS) losing 1.25%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HGrtWgk) losing 0.66% and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/1z21KR2) finishing down almost 90 points as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/fqwvn71) spiking again by more than 11%, thought it was even higher at the start of the day.

We saw more companies declining [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/8sr5bqw), but only saw 8 new lows, while the number of companies moving above the moving averages is still very high. We also saw only 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/HgZTxtj) finish the day in the green, with Energy in the lead, while Materials finished flat and Real Estate, Communications and Consumer Discretionary were the biggest losers dropping more than 1% as we saw mostly large-cap growth companies losing ground, with small & mid-caps outperforming yet again, continuing the [TREND](https://ibb.co/8x5m4cc) that can also be seen from the start of 2021.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/m9Jb0sS) from yesterday, you can see almost all big tech companies lost ground, with Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Netflix losing more than 2% while Tesla also lost almost 8% after an 11day winning streak. The biggest gains were made in the semiconductors & drug manufacturers.

[Today](https://ibb.co/Xp3hvr0) we get don’t get that much economic data, as we wait for more heavy days starting tomorrow.

In some other stock market news, we saw [LEMONADE](https://ibb.co/K7YV26k) take quite a ride again yesterday, going from barely down for the day, up to a huge gain of 14%, after the COO of the [COMPANY](https://ibb.co/9cCz2XD) went on Twitter and attacked the Seeking Alpha bearish articles on the company, only to later in after hours to announce they will [SELL](https://ibb.co/hYqJJHZ) shares again for corporate purposes. This is further testimony to the point I have been making in the past weeks, that companies are very incentivized to sell stock to raise capital or even for the management of the company to realize some gains. I really like Lemonade and will hold them for the long-term, but after a 200% increase in the past couple of [MONTHS](https://ibb.co/Dp1csg0), I trimmed my positions in the company by selling out the cost basis and letting the profits run, though I might add to this position if a significant pullback or correction appears.

Moving on, we also saw [WALMART](https://ibb.co/pL18LYP) being the latest company that is planning to make a pus in the fintech world. This is really nice news to hear from the company, as they try to diversify their revenue stream even more, while they are also trying to compete more & more with Amazon in the online retail business.

In the hardware technology [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/b6S6yKn), we saw Apple gaining some market share of the global PC shipments which has seen an overall 13% increase in 2020, the biggest such spike since 2010. I think Apple has room to grow this market share even more with the continuing improvements and adopting of their latest in-house chips.

We also saw some developments in the health care world, with JNJ’s vaccine [EXPECTED](https://ibb.co/LC4Qsgp) to deliver results by the end of the month, keep in mind this is my favorite vaccine play, with their vaccine only needing 1 shot and not requiring such extreme storage conditions like the Pfizer & Moderna ones, while also being expected to have better results than AstraZeneca’s vaccine.

Also, Eli [Lilly](https://ibb.co/Y8t0gm2) delivered some promising results on their Alzheimer’s study, which led the stock to have a big pop yesterday.

And in the IPO world we will have [AFFIRM](https://ibb.co/tbdgmjP) Holdings on the deck, as we found out that the fintech Affirm will start its IPO price from at least $41, but it’s really hard to believe shares will reach the market for retail traders under $60-$70.

And one last piece of news, exactly like I told you yesterday, [NIO](https://ibb.co/Wv8nRpy) opened higher on the huge hype after the NIO Day, almost touching 67$ before dropping to under 63$ to finish the day, only to [DROP](https://ibb.co/dpzHh7Q) even more after hours, before recovering today in pre-market. It’s a wild ride with this company. I see some short-term downside, but long-term upside for this company.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as I think there is a significant possibility that with this new stimulus checks, we might see another increase in stock trading from people who are receiving these checks. Last [TIME](https://ibb.co/sFWcyRp) around securities trading was one of the top ways that money was used in most of the income brackets. Today the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/FBxg7s8) Markets are pretty flat and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/s22g9Pb) are mixed, with the Dow slightly down, while the Nasdaq is leading the way.

1808,How to Actively Trade Around Earnings,487,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/giof04/how_to_actively_trade_around_earnings/,75,"It’s earnings season and with that we’ve seen an influx of earnings related posts. Over the course of my 10 years of investing and trading I learned a few things about trading during earnings season. In this post I’m going to attempt to outline how to approach earnings and profit off of this season. Unlike most of my posts about long-term investing, this will be the rare active trading post.

For starters, let’s cover the basics of what quarterly earnings are. Publicly traded companies report earnings four times a year, and while most companies follow the calendar year for their fiscal year, some (such as Disney and Microsoft) use a different fiscal year. You may see Q2 earnings in April, or Q1 in October. The important thing to understand is, for the most part, the actual quarter is irrelevant. Prior to an earnings report from being released analysts will use advanced modelling techniques to predict a company’s EPS. Companies are then judged on whether they hit these predictions. The stock price can often fluctuate greatly on whether they hit or missed the consensus prediction.

Now that we understand what earnings are, how do we profit during the volatile earnings season? Let’s outline different strategies and how to implement them

1. The most consistent way to trade around earnings season is the simplest. **Don’t trade!** Earnings season brings additional volatility and often causes emotional trading. Emotional trading can lead to massive losses. Bottom line, if you’re an emotional trader, don’t trade around earnings.
2. The best way to profit during earnings season from my experience is by missing the largest move. In other words, never hold a position, whether it’s a long, short, or options position through earnings. Trade the volatility and hype leading up to earnings and lock in your profits before the report. After the earnings trade the momentum. Don’t be afraid to go long leading up to earnings and shorting after a miss.
3. The final strategy is holding a position through earnings. This is the riskiest option since a miss (if you’re long) or a hit (if you’re short) can cause massive losses. While this is a strategy I rarely implement, you can still be profitable if you approach it in the right way. If you plan to hold through earnings look for companies where the analysts have historically been wrong on earnings. Additionally, look at the individual analyst predictions and remember a hit/miss is based off their consensus. For example, if you have 3 analyst predictions and two predict a 5c EPS and one predicts a -1c EPS the consensus will be 3c EPS, you may be able to conclude that the company is likely to hit since one analyst low balled earnings. You can also read up on how accurate each analyst is and use that knowledge in your trading strategies. This is typically a bit challenging and requires a good amount of digging which is a key reason why I rarely employ this strategy personally.

These three basic approaches are far from all-encompassing but they cover the basics for newer traders. If you’ve just started trading during the COVID-19 pandemic it’s likely wise to avoid the 3rd option listed above. These are not normal times and volatility is already higher than normal.

Good luck trading around earnings and remember to take your profits and cut your losses quickly.",2020-05-13 11:47:18

You get this power very quickly... Nobody is going to call them out on their bulls***.”

> 
> Here’s the rub: Krohn was the subject of a 2012 Securities and Exchange Commission complaint for fraudulently offering and selling real estate investments. The court ruled in the SEC’s favor, and Krohn had to pay a $75,000 fine. He did not return a phone call and email seeking comment.

I'm not here to convince anyone of anything, but here are some questions to ask yourself:

* Is Tesla's data lead (2 orders of magnitude and counting....360k vehicles on the road right now sending training data back to base at every driver intervention) unassailable?
* Does Tesla have the best, cheapest and most energy efficient self driving computer?
* Has Tesla built custom software for their custom hardware which will provide efficiencies no one else can match unless they too build their own full self driving (FSD) hardware and software?
* Will Tesla be first to achieve (FSD)?
* Will Tesla be first to gain regulatory approval for FSD?
* Is Tesla the ONLY vehicle manufacturer producing FSD-ready vehicles RIGHT NOW?
* Will Tesla's Model 3 drive train last 1 million+ miles?
* Will the new battery (next year) last 1 million+ miles?
* Will Uber, Lyft, Waymo raise capital and run at enormous losses so they can cut their ride costs by 100-200% to compete with the Tesla robo taxis, or will they begin building or buying their own vehicles. If so, who from?
* What will happen to the value of existing vehicles on the road when Tesla achieves FSD?
* What will happen to company valuations of ICE manufacturers who haven't transitioned ALL new vehicles to electric AND full self driving when the first EV manufacturer achieves FSD?
* What will happen to Tesla's net profit when they ""turn on"" their robo taxi fleet, taking 25-30% of all user-owned rides, and 100% of all Tesla-owned rides? Approx cashflow analysis suggests a $38,000 (retail) Model 3 will generate $30,000/yr in the fleet, and last 10 years. **READ THAT AGAIN**. A $38,000 asset (built for less, but consumers can buy for that) can ROI \~80% in year 1.... year 2 and beyond is pure cream.
* Did Tesla executed on EVERYTHING in the ""Secret Tesla Master Plan"" of 2006 ( [https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me](https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me) )?
* Is Tesla on the way to executing EVERYTHING in Master Plan Part Deux ([https://www.tesla.com/BLOG/MASTER-PLAN-PART-DEUX](https://www.tesla.com/BLOG/MASTER-PLAN-PART-DEUX))?
* Who is poised to produce an equivalent or better vehicle at scale?

Stocks fell once again today for the third straight day of losses, as market participants consider a disappointing unemployment report, new virus-related restrictions in Europe, and dimming prospects for additional stimulus before the november election

The Nasdaq finished 0.67% down. The S&P 500 (SPY) fell a modest 0.11% and the Dow finished the day 0.04% down. Stocks were able to mostly recover from the deeply red open. 

The Labor Department released their weekly unemployment, which showed that an additional 898,000 new claims were submitted last week, way above the consensus estimate of 830,000.  This is the highest number since Aug. 22 and another clear sign that the labor market continues to struggle to recover in this pandemic-riddled economy as cases rise and worries increase over a renewed wave in the fall and winter. The number represented a gain of 53,000 from the previous week’s. The economy has recaptured some 11.4 million positions, or about half those who were sidelined. The unemployment rate has come down to 7.9% but is still more than double its pre-pandemic level.

After Europe seemed to somewhat tame the virus that ravaged the countryside early in the year, the number of newly confirmed infections are skyrocketing, prompting fears of a second-wave and host of new restrictions. Socialising indoors will be banned in London, and a curfew will be imposed in nine French cities. Poland designated red zones where schools and gyms will close, including in the capital Warsaw, and the Czech Republic said it was building its first field hospital for coronavirus patients. Schools in Italy's southern Campania region, including the city of Naples, are to close for two weeks, as the country recorded its highest daily rise of cases since mass testing began. Coronavirus is the fifth-leading cause of death in Europe, where a threshold of 1,000 deaths daily has been passed, the WHO's European director, Dr Hans Kluge, told a news conference today. In the United States, new cases per day are on the rise in 44 states, with the biggest surges in the Midwest and Great Plains, where resistance to wearing masks and observing other social distancing practices has been running high. Deaths per day are climbing in 30 states, according to data collected from John Hopkins University.

Market participants continue to be fixated on whether more stimulus, which lawmakers and economists say is necessary, will be passed before the November election. Messaging from top officials regarding stimulus has been inconsistent, with Pres. Trump first said he was directing his representatives to halt negotiations before doing a 180 degree turn. Yesterday, Mnuchin conceded that “getting something done before the election and executing on that would be difficult, just given where we are in the level of details”. Today, in response to being asked if he supported stimulus, Pres. Trump told Fox Business, “I would. Absolutely I would. I would say more. I would go higher. Go big or go home, I said it yesterday.” Needless to say the inconsistent messaging heightened volatility in the market as investors have a heightened sense of risk. Additional relief is viewed by many (including Jerome Powell) as a necessary propellant to maintain and speed up economic recovery.

Aphria is merging with Tilray while the stimulus may be agreed on today after the latest developments. Also, the FED starts its 2-day meeting, let’s talk about this and everything happening in the stock market**

**\~Very Long Post\~** 

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we see a great day for the stock market, the best in December actually, as a one-two punch of stimulus and vaccine data helped the rally, with the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/XkRWtZS) finishing up 1.29%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/dPpXW1X) 1.25% and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/smC2WMp) 1.13%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/F07KNd4) dropping more than 7% from the recent highs, as it was nearing the 25 levels which would imply more volatility ahead for the stock market.

We saw ¾ of the companies gaining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/PG7tysH) on decent volume, with 145 new highs, as all 11 sectors finished in the green, with Utilities and Energy leading the way up almost 2%, while just 2 [sectors](https://ibb.co/1sqbPxT) gained less than 1% for the day, the Communications sector and the consumer staples. This rally was pushed by almost every type of [company](https://ibb.co/5xf4s1b), especially small and mid-caps, as large-caps lagged a bit and were pretty much flat for the day, with the exception of Apple as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TT2xp03), as I said in a previous post, I believe that Apple is ready for takeoff after more and more reports of great numbers in the new iPhone 12 lineup sales, and with the Fitness+ service launching this Monday this keeps increasing the number of services that Apple offers. I believe that the Apple One bundle will be a great revenue stream for them alongside the move to the 5G in the next years.

So here is the economic [calendar](https://ibb.co/dcbS2NG) for today as we start off early in the morning with MBA mortgage applications, followed but retail sales, PMI, inventories and finish up with the last meeting and decisions from the FED in 2020.

We also received news that as soon as the FDA & CDC give approval, which could and probably will happen as soon as this weekend, [Moderna](https://ibb.co/B3q3Dkv) will be able to ship over 6M doses right away, more than double what Pfizer delivered in the initial shipment.

This is happening while the stimulus appears closer than ever, but it should be noted that it does appear it will not include any stimulus checks for citizens. As the Congress seems to be targeting a $750B relief [package](https://ibb.co/pvWY3bB). This is very needed as the savings, especially for low-income households, has been substantially on the [declin](https://ibb.co/SVwG1DD) since May, just like always, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

This measures from the Government have been unexpectedly just been called upon from Warren [Buffett](https://ibb.co/cv0v8h9) also, as he emphasized that small businesses have become collateral damage, though he previously said he wouldn’t speak in public about this until May, the degrading situation probably made him change his mind. 

We will also have the FED starting its meetings [today](https://ibb.co/jy1TDvh), and follow up tomorrow, with most analysts expecting the FED to lay out the plans for additional asset purchases to provide additional support for the economy. And even if this is a temporary measure, it would be great for the economy if they keep this program going until the vaccine is more widely available and the reopening can come back in full force.

Yesterday we also got numbers on the Industrial [Production](https://ibb.co/xG9Rnsr), which beat the consensus with a .4% increase M/M while capacity utilization also increased with the manufacturing output way better than expected. This was led especially by motor vehicle and parts sales which were up 5.3%.

So, with some good news in the last period, a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/4dn08gY) showed that fewer respondents believe that stocks are overpriced or overvalued right now. I think this is a fair opinion, as we have gone through a period of consolidation since the beginning of [November](https://ibb.co/zVZ3vQQ), stocks have become more stable, some have lost ground, some have gained. This is very healthy for the broad stock market and may eventually start a new bull run very soon.

On some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/B22drnZ), we saw the whole green energy sector getting a big boost yesterday, as the US Congress seems to have agreed to a [package](https://ibb.co/GxpqGB6) of tax incentives and extensions for both wind and solar projects. Some of the biggest gainers yesterday were SunPower, Enphase, SolarEdge, with most of the companies from the INVESCO Solar ETF trading way higher. As we also saw [PENN](https://ibb.co/7zrVQMG) national gaining yesterday after giving great news again to investors, as they have acquired a new casino in Maryland as they keep expanding their nationwide footprint.

Meanwhile, we will get [Lennar](https://ibb.co/8482vyk) Q4 earnings today after the close, and I expect them to have a great quarter, but this hasn’t helped many companies this quarter, as even great earnings results haven’t pushed most companies to have big gains, I think Lennar will post a terrific quarter as a result of the continuing strong housing market as more and [more](https://ibb.co/QjbZsDz) people flee big cities attracted by better tax implications while they also run from the growing poverty in states like California.

Some good [news](https://ibb.co/rHYtC04) also came from the Eurozone this morning, as the PMI popped up to 49.8 which is still a contraction for the economy, but that is an improving view of the economy overseas, up from 45.3 in November.

We also have to keep an eye on what [ABNB](https://ibb.co/WPQ214K) and Doordash will do, as investors are starting to get the chance to short this highly valued IPOs. So, this might hit the stocks even more after they have suffered in the last days as I expected.

And one last bit of [news](https://ibb.co/j6Fxdv5), Aphria is merging with Tilray, they will become an almost $4B market cap cannabis player, as they seek to also move to the US and grow its market share in the country, as the full legalizing of cannabis in the US seems to be approaching.  This will help both companies to be able to have low-cost, state of the art cultivations alongside improved processing and manufacturing facilities. This will also position them for a better footprint in the EU, with Aphria having a footprint in Germany, while Tilray has a low-cost production facility in Portugal.

I think the pot and clean energy sectors alongside the EVs are the ones to watch in the next years.

Let’s hope for another great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/HY1vfFP) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.

The MM probably hired an army of lobbyists to manipulate the decision-makers and people reporting to the white house, telling everybody that GME is going to cause another crash, and this is the last thing a new administration wants. They freaked out, and they probably approved what happened

&#x200B;

* **Are we harming the economy? NO.. We are building it.**

1. GME now has an inflated valuation .. yes. They will use it to expand and acquire smaller businesses and hire people.. Real economical progress
2. They can now pay their debts to creditors
3. Individual investors will use their profits to pay their credit card bills, buy a house, buy something.. The money is inside the market.
4. Individual investors from all over the world will use their profits to invest in other companies that will increase in value and expand.

* **We invest differently, They don't like it**

1. We are young passionate people with our own ideas. We don't share the same investment routine and style of older generations. We invest in a better future.. We invest in clean energy, Electric vehicles. We don't invest in shorting small business and crushing peoples dreams
2. We don't play by the wall street rules. We make our own research and our own analysis. we don't count on the analysis of biased analysts telling us how to invest. They are losing influence and that's why they are fighting us.
3. They benefit from our greed and we also were just benefiting from theirs. They have been making money out of the greed of some of us or sometimes the poor research we do regarding certain investments. We found their greed and we took advantage of it. We are actually doing SEC a favor by exposing the weaknesses of the system.
4. We don't need guidance on how to invest. We are mature people and we know the risk of what we are doing. They allowed retail investors to invest in companies with no products or employees.. some of these companies reached 55Bn in market cap.

1847,PSA: This is a good time to be skeptical of EV startups,456,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kvirkw/psa_this_is_a_good_time_to_be_skeptical_of_ev/,257,"At the height of the dot-com boom in '99, investors were so caught up in the rise of a new industry that they threw money at anything with a website, regardless of the fundamentals. With the incredible rise of TSLA, I think we are at risk for a similar phenomenon with EV startups. It seems like everyone and their dog has an EV company right now. If you have a website and a flashy design concept, there is a lot of money to be made with investor cash.

**I am not saying don't invest in these startups, but there are a few things to keep in mind:**

* It's incredibly difficult and capital-intensive to start a car company. History is littered with failures in this industry (See Fisker, Faraday Future, Delorean, etc.).
* Elon Musk is a savvy businessman, shrewd technologist, and a master of publicity. He is the exception among startup CEOs, not the rule. He built Tesla with a diligent plan; and even then barely made it at times (See original roadster launch issues, Model 3 production issues). He is Tesla's greatest asset and we shouldn't assume that his success can be easily replicated.
* Traditional car companies have been slow to start, but they now realize EVs are the future and are starting to come out with their own models. While EV technology may be new to them, they have a huge advantage in terms of manufacturing infrastructure and expertise that will make it even harder for EV startups to gain foothold in the market.

The bottom line here is that investors should have realistic expectations about the chance of a new company's success. Investors who missed out on TSLA will be driven by FOMO to throw money at anything with four wheels and a battery. This can attract scammers (See Theranos) who want some of that easy capital. It's smart to be vigilant when there is so much hype around a particular industry.

**TLDR** \- Invest in whatever makes sense for you, but be cautious and don't let FOMO take control.",2021-01-12 13:58:46

GME is not a question of a business model in the future, it is a question of right now. I understand the need for numbers and figures, I do. Technical and fundamental research is viable and necessary, but one very over looked method of analysis is philosophical. We have seen DD after DD talking about the numbers and the business model. But I want to share some thoughts with you of my logical thinking and would love to see counter points.

**First Let's Recap**

**Pre-Earnings (Aug-Dec)**

Already was running up and then r/wallstreetbets massive hype of a short squeeze and Cohen letters leads to a run-up followed by a sell-off due to overbuying.

**During Earnings (12/7):**

[Earnings Call Transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/12/09/gamestop-gme-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)

The conversation and presentation actually had good content. Their balance sheet looks fantastic; eliminated debt, reduced costs, making changes towards the digital transformation, e-commerce way up, console sales upcoming, new inventory and other positives they didn't even mention like the [Microsoft deal](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/). But the stock plummets...why?

There were two pieces of ""bad news"": ""missed revenue"" and ""shelf offering"" which PR blasted in a very negative light taking it completely out of context. Revenue missed was expected, not just because it's GME but because of COVID-19 effects on a retail business.

Revenue: Loss was expected, not just because it's GME but because of COVID-19 effects on a retail business.

Shelf offering: $100M and has two years to be used.

First comment was by Jim Bell: """"However, as a pragmatic matter initiating this program provides us with the maximum flexibility and optionality to further bolster our balance sheet and liquidity position and increase flexibility gives us the ability to leverage opportunities to accelerate our transformational strategies, such as increasing the speed at which we elevate expand our omni-channel strategy while further ensuring minimal disruption from any potential further pandemic impacts around the world.""

When asked by William Reuter from BoA. ""OK. And then, in terms of the new shelf, you know, I saw that you mentioned general corporate purposes. Would you consider issuing stocks to repay debt under that program?""

George Sherman responded: ""No, that's absolutely not the intent. The intent here is to simply optimize flexibility and optionality. Period. There is a lot of unknowns going on in the marketplace with respect to this pandemic, ongoing flex of cases across the world, the impacts on our own businesses.""

My thought: It's a defense mechanism to attempt to do one of three things:

1. Help combat against a Cohen takeover
2. Collect profits on their way out because they know a short squeeze is imminent
3. They truly want to use it as they said

My issue with 3 and what they said when asked by William Reuter, is that they have significantly improved the balance sheet and COVID-19 vaccinations have begun, not to mention they are intending on shifting focus on e-commerce, so it just struck me as a very odd reasons for a shelf offer.

Nonetheless, during this call the share price absolutely plummets, but why? We received a lot of good news and two pieces of ""bad news"". One was expected (revenue loss) and one was addressed during the call (shelf offering). There was no intent on share dilution at least not anytime soon.

My thoughts: Only thing I can think is PR putting a negative spin, but more-so it was the bears using the negative PR to their advantage to drive the price down. $14 was the floor by the end of AH.

**Post Earnings (12/9):**

A war rages over $14 keeping it nearly level the entire day.

My thoughts: Bears expected much lower yet the bulls fought hard. On a bleeding red day where bulls clearly had the disadvantaged portfolios, they were able to support and actually start a small uptrend.

\#WeWantCohen starts trending and Ryan Cohen puts out a [cryptic Tweet](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1336775515101949963).

My thoughts: He is completely dissatisfied with management and their ability to address his concerns outline in the letter. After ER the PR that went out and thoughts on the future of the company could have been beautiful if addressed and pitched correctly. Management did not provide comfort in the eyes of anyone and the stock price reflects that as does the PR.

**What's Next?**

The moment you've all been waiting for. Let's gather some facts.

1. Individuals own 9.87%
2. Cohen (RC) owns 9.98%
3. Michael Burry ( Scion) owns 2.44%
4. GameStop Market Cap $890.11 Million
5. Cohen net worth $600 Million

Cohen could either purchase enough shares to have majority vote or he can outright make an offer to buy the company. So why hasn't he?

There are two current possibilities:

1. He conducts a hostile takeover.
2. He has no plans to conduct a hostile takeover.

Reason 1 probable timing and outcome: If you were about to make a large purchase, wouldn't you want to get it at the best price possible? He's waiting until he feels like we are actually at the floor before making a move. Truthfully, all he has to do is speak. If he even mentions an intent of acquisition the shorts will run and the bulls will pile in triggering the squeeze. **Bulls win**

Reason 2 is interesting because why would he own 10% of a company where he clearly doesn't believe in current management? So, if a hostile takeover isn't the reason, then what is?

I can think of two possibilities:

1. There is already something happening behind the scenes to peacefully put Cohen into a position of power. **Bulls win**
2. He thought being 10% owner would give him a large enough voice to be convincing, when he realized the board does not share his vision, he pulls out. **Bears win**

Now, this is interesting.

Reason 1 seems highly unlikely to me simply due to his tweet today. If there were plans for a peaceful transition of power, I don't think he would add fuel to the fire of bad PR clearly doubting managements skills.

Reason 2 is juicy. Between RC, Scion and Individual investors who all want to see Cohen at the helm, that accounts for 22.29% of the company. If RC pulls out, the rest follow, no bulls left to fight the bears, the institutions pull out and GME becomes a penny stock.

My overall prediction is the **bulls win.** The reason being, I can chart one path to victory for the bears but many paths to victory for the bulls. Also, I do not think we will need to wait until Q4ER to see the squeeze. From each scenario I could think of, Cohen would act sooner rather than later if he intends on purchasing or accumulating enough shares for proxy in order to get the best price possible.

Notice how nothing I said has to do with the future of the business or the business model as a whole? That's because that doesn't matter. Q4 earnings will boost the price high enough for bulls to profit a little and then get out if they don't believe in the company. The overall longevity of the company is a completely different debate.

1857,This is how you know if a stock is a buy,445,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fj6f6y/this_is_how_you_know_if_a_stock_is_a_buy/,107,"A lot of people buy stocks because it feels right and they think the company will be around for a while.

When you buy a stock you’re buying into the company therefore you want to look at several factors rather than just go with your gut, if you don’t look at the following factors then you’re better off buying mutual funds or index funds such as VOO and QQQ.

Let’s proceed:

1. Pull up the balance sheet for the last quarter, the last year and the last 5 years. Look at 2 categories, assets (money/money making investments)and liabilities (debt/long term expenses)

The total assets should be 2x or more of the total liabilities. The short term assets should also be about 1.5-2x the short term liabilities. If the balance sheet looks good move onto #2, if not move onto the next company.

THIS ALONE CUTS HALF THE STOCKS MOST PEOPLE “FEEL LIKE ARE A GOOD BUY”

2) Ok so you found a company with a good balance sheet, great! Now let’s look at the historical earnings, look at these for the past 10 years. Are the quarterly earnings growing steadily like you want them to be? Or are there huge peaks and valleys showing a more volatile company? Are they trending downwards showing the company is losing money consistently? Or are they flat/slowly growing showing a steady but boring company?

If the historical quarterly earnings over 10 years are steadily growing, that’s what you want. So move onto 3)...

3) now let’s look at the EPS, this is how much you’re paying for the earnings you receive. Lower is generally better, anything over 20PE is considered high. Look at Ford to see an extremely high PE showing an extremely overvalued company, even at $5 a share!

4) Does the company pay a dividend? This means the company pays you money, typically quarterly, to hold their stock. Not always necessary because a lot of high growth tech stocks don’t but you make a ton due to natural growth, but a dividend is nice.

This will get you started. If you don’t do this for every stock you want to buy then you’re just buying stocks based on emotion and what you “think” looks good on a chart, and you will lose money more often than not.

EDIT: I feel the need to say this is NOT a one size fits all, this is just a good way to find out the value of a company. 

Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Tesla, etc. do not follow this formula, but this can tell you how to price companies like airlines.",2020-03-16 05:58:09

Google is partnering with the US Government in developing a nationwide website that includes information about COVID-19 symptoms, risk and testing information. This is in addition to other measures we are taking, including: a Google “home page promotion” to promote greater awareness of simple measures citizens can take to prevent the spread of the disease; Work being done by our sister company Verily to launch a pilot website that will enable individuals to do a risk assessment and be scheduled for testing at sites in the Bay Area; Promoting authoritative information through Google Search and YouTube; taking measures to protect users from misinformation, including phishing, conspiracy theories, malware and misinformation; Rolling out free access to our advanced Hangouts Meet video-conferencing capabilities to all G Suite and G Suite for Education customers globally until 7/01/20; advancing health research and science; and financially supporting global relief efforts.

Initial reactions by Google/Alphabet on Friday indicated that the White House and Google didn't coordinate at all. Now, it appears Google has bended the knee to the President of the United States.

> He thinks he can order a company to do something by suggesting they're already working on it, and shaming them for not having enough done already in a few days, then blaming it all on Google when it doesn't happen.

Looks like a President can, in fact, do just that.",2020-03-15 13:57:16

Airbnb recently announced in their filings that:

* 54 million active bookers worldwide booked 327 million nights and experiences on the platform.
* The company believes its serviceable addressable market (SAM) is $1.5 trillion.
* The company has achieved **$4.8 billion** in revenue for the year 2019, a **29.7% YoY** over the **$3.7 billion** earned in 2018.

I learned about NIO over two years ago when they were featured on 60 Minutes and was one of the first active users on r/Nio. Back then, the stock was 10$, and I bought 500 shares. But after their IPO, they had a rough year with declining sales. Despite that, I kept buying in to eventually accumulate 3,200 shares at an average price of 3.12$.

But then came more bad news and worse sales. People were talking about the company running out of cash and the stock going to 0$, and they did eventually hit 1.00$. I sold at 1.78$ before that happened and took my 57% loss.

I've only been investing for two years, but it's my biggest regret so far. I should have never listened to some asshole at Bloomberg getting paid to write negative articles and trusted my gut. NIO is a solid company and is going to be one the leaders in the Chinese and global EV market. They completely restructured after those losses (Nio Places vs. Nio Houses, fired staff, etc.), and those 3,200 shares are worth over 150,000$ today. They'll be worth even more in the future.

1866,Before you buy Tesla please read this,432,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hmhi6u/before_you_buy_tesla_please_read_this/,412,"I know FOMO is real. I’ve felt it, I’ve followed it, and I’ve been burned from FOMO. But please put the valuation of Tesla into perspective. 

Tesla is worth 254 billion. 
Ford is worth 24.62 billion. 
GM is worth 36.82 billion 

Tesla has 24 billion yearly revenues (trading 10.58x sales) 
Ford has 155 billion yearly revenues 
GM has 137 billion yearly revenues. 

Tesla can dilute their stock by 10% to buy Ford, putting the stock price to just what it OPENED at TODAY.
Tesla can dilute their stock by 15% to buy GM, putting their stock price to what it CLOSED at THURSDAY. 

I know, I know. Tesla is growing exponentially and they MIGHT have 100 billion in revenue in 5 years. That’s still 35% lower than Fords revenue. Tesla is profitable, and Ford isn’t. That needs to be considered in the valuation, putting Tesla at a higher valuation than Ford. But is Tesla really worth 10x Ford, today? That’s highly unlikely. 

Tesla has grown 45% in 5 trading days. It’s highly overbought and their trading higher than 70 RSI on nearly every single chart you can look at. It’s also trading higher than its upper bollinger band. A pull back WILL happen. It might hit 1500 before the pull back, but it might not. The risk/reward is bad on Tesla at the AH price of 1414. It’s highly risky right now. Please do not fall into the FOMO trap. I promise you you WILL NOT MISS OUT if you wait! You will be able to buy in cheaper. I think even bulls and bears can agree on this. 

I’m bullish on Tesla for the long term, but I am currently short right now. It’s just simply overran itself.

Don’t fall into FOMO. 

And before someone says it, I don’t think Tesla will buy Ford or GM, or that even they would sell. It’s just for a perspective look.",2020-07-07 08:59:02

1895,Some interesting news in the stock market this week,419,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/dqindj/some_interesting_news_in_the_stock_market_this/,33,"Lots of news this week with earnings season in full swing as well as a few other controversial developments. I am going to start with the large caps before moving on to smaller companies and have tried to categorize them as much as possible for those who prefer to dip in and out. 

Starting with the big caps, **Alphabet** reported strong Q3 earnings on Tuesday before proceeding to buy Fitbit on Friday for $2.1 billion (70% above the pre-rumour price). The earnings report however got a more negative reception due to losses on equity holdings (probably Uber) impacting Alphabet’s net profitability by almost $3 billion. Excluding these items revenues were up 20% and core earnings up 17% resulting in an encouraging continuation of the strong growth reported in Q2. The stock closed on Friday with an attractive trailing PE of 27.33 (or 23.9 when adjusted for net cash of $144 million).

There was some good news for **Johnson & Johnson** on Tuesday as they reported that independent testing had confirmed that there was no asbestos in the Baby Powder that had been recalled after the FDA reported that trace amounts had been found. It was good news for J&J but the FDA was unconvinced and stood by its findings. 

**Beyond Meat** reported strong results after the bell on Monday with sales up 250%. However the stock price dropped sharply on Tuesday (20%) after a wave of selling followed the end of the lockup period as shareholders holding 80% of outstanding shares were allowed, for the first time, to sell and lock in some profits.

On Wednesday **Twitter** announced it would ban all political advertising in a move that will probably heap pressure on **Facebook** to do the same. Whilst a newsworthy story it is unlikely to have a big impact on either company with Facebook potentially losing out on 0.5% of revenues next year and Twitter even less. However it should have a more positive impact for local television and radio stations who will benefit as political advertisements switch to traditional media (if anyone knows a good local media stock please let me know).

&#x200B;

**Growth stocks (Purple Innovation, Universal Display and Teladoc)** 

On Thursday the mattress manufacturer Tempur Sealy jumped 11% after revenues increase 3% and earnings 15% but in my opinion it is Tempurs rival and mattress industry disruptor **Purple Innovation** that would make a much better investment.

Tempur's stock price has doubled this year and is valued at almost 2x revenues and 30x earnings which seems generous for a stock operating in a slow growing and cyclical industry.  However industry disrupter Purple Innovation is growing rapidly through direct online mattress sales and is priced on just 1x sales and 25x current year estimates (15x next years).

Purple is the second biggest “bed in a box” company, after Casper, and was founded by Utah based scientist entrepreneurs Tony and Terry Pearse after they developed and patented Hypo Elastic Polymer (HEP).  HEP is reportedly ""bouncy, responsive, and soft"" and more like a gel than foam (for those that need more explanation see link at bottom “myslumberyard”).

This benefit has not been missed by customers and Q2 revenues reported in August were up 36%, margins were up and guidance was raised significantly with revenue of $400 million to $425 million (from $350 million to $375 million) and EBITDA of $24 million to $27 million (from $3 million to $8 million) .

CEO Joe Megibow said ""I am confident that we are well positioned to profitably capitalize on the numerous growth opportunities we believe exist for the Company in the near and long-term.""

The internet combined with the ability to ship a quality mattress anywhere in the country inexpensively has disrupted the whole mattress industry. Purple Innovation has grown quickly and executed well since it was listed in February 2018 but this has not been reflected in the stock price.

The company is expected to report profitability for the first time this year. This should be a good catalyst to drive the stock to a higher multiple. Economies of scale and the opportunity to win share in a huge market offer great potential.

**Universal Display**’s stock price jumped 15% after strong results on Wednesday. The stock already had an eye wateringly high valuation but the opportunity for growth from OLED televisions is truly remarkable and, in my opinion, the optimism is justified.

Universal Display owns more than 5,000 organic light emitting diode (OLED) patents that generate royalties from OLED manufacturers based on smart phone screen area manufactured. That screen area is increasing rapidly. The smart phone sector still has some growth left in it but the real opportunity is OLED televisions (with each 60 inch tv equating to almost 100 smart phones) which are expected to drive 150% growth over the next four years.

Now assuming Universal Display's revenues increase by 150% and its net margin increases from 33% (yes 33% is correct) to 40%, then earnings of $400 million on a PE of 24 would just about pretty much justify the current valuation. That doesn’t offer much of a cushion for investors wanting to buy in unless there are significant opportunities for growth beyond five years.

Well there are significant opportunities.  OLEDs are the most efficient way to turn electricity into light. They are flexible and can be produced in any shape and are capable of producing a softer more pleasant ambient lighting. Televisions have a long run way of growth ahead of them but lighting has not even gotten started. According to a report last year from ResearchAndMarkets, sales of OLED lighting products are set to grow at 50% p.a. to $1.4 billion by 2022. And even that's only scratching the surface. Sales are expected to increase a further fourfold by 2027.

For me Universal Display's valuation is eye watering. It is a growth stock priced for perfection and will fall sharply with any set back. However the opportunity is huge and, with Universal Display owning the intellectual property, so is the potential upside.

**Teladoc’s** stock increased 14% after reporting 24% revenue growth on Wednesday but the company faces many competitors and Amazon has already dipped its toe into remote medical services.

Teledoc uses telephone and videoconferencing technology to provide on-demand remote medical services. This is a large industry (estimated at $20bn) and growing quickly (estimated at 17% p.a.). Teladoc, with a market cap $5.5bn, is currently the best known and largest player in the sector. 

However, in my opinion, growth of 24% is not sufficient to support a valuation of 10x revenues unless the company has a significant competitive moat and clear runway to market dominance. Teladoc does not have that. There are plenty of competitors (even if none of them are listed) who are willing to offer cheaper pricing in order to chip away at Teladoc’s market share.  More worrying is that Teladoc’s 70% gross profit margins have caught the eye of Amazon who announced the launch of Amazon Care in September. That scheme is initially being tested on a small number of Amazon employees but it is almost certain to grow and become a competitor for Teladoc.

&#x200B;

**Value stocks (Royal Carribean and Hanesbrands)**

**Royal Caribbean** dropped on Wednesday after reporting its best Q3 ever. The company missed expectations by a few cents but still managed to increase earnings by 9% compared to last year. A remarkable achievement given Hurricane Dorian “the most disruptive storm in the company’s history” knocked 13 cents off the total.  The company issued 2019 guidance with EPS of $9.50-9.55 meaning the stock ($111.15 at Friday’s close) is only trading on 11.7x current year guidance. Additionally, in an encouraging article reported by Barron’s, Royal Caribbean’s CEO said that he expects a ""very robust 2020""

**Hanesbrands** also dropped after reporting good results but managed to recover most of those losses by Friday. Constant currency sales were up 2%, earnings increased 4% and full year guidance for sales and earnings were increased to show similar growth.  Sales at Hanesbrands’ increasingly popular retro brand Champion increased by 25% which was less than 50% last quarter but still very encouraging. 

However, even after the stocks recovery, the trailing PE for Hanesbrands was just 9.68 at Fridays close. In my opinion the market is missing the bigger picture. Hanesbrands is a stable company with its Champion brand enjoying a retro revival. According to a Bloomberg report in April, teenage boys rank Champion among their 15 favorite brands alongside designers Gucci and Tommy Hilfiger. Such a brand surely is worthy of a much better multiple -- perhaps even 15x.

&#x200B;

**Great company but too pricey (Moody’s)**

**Moody’s Corporation** reported a beat and raise on Wednesday with revenues up 15%, earnings up 27% and FY 2019 guidance increased from adjusted EPS $8.05 to $8.125 at the midpoint ($7.39 last year).

Moody's is an attractive business. The largest player by a margin in the duopoly/oligopoly that is the credit rating business. Regulatory requirements are increasing, long term bond issuance is increasing (even if short term down turns continue) and investors demand either a Moody's or S&P rating (preferably Moody's).  That makes it nearly impossible for new entrants.

During the Great Recession (which caused no shortage of criticism of the rating agencies) revenues only fell briefly in 2007 before beginning their relentless march upwards again.

However, a lot of this good news is now priced in. The stock is up 70% from year lows and, valued at 27.1x current year estimates, it is no longer the bargain it was.

In short I think Moody’s is a great company and a long term hold. But I'm going to wait for the next market wobble. I don't think that wobble will be anything as bad as 2007 but, nevertheless, I think I'll be able to pick up Moody’s stock a lot cheaper.

&#x200B;

**Speculative and high risk (Sprint and Tupperware Brands)**

**Sprint Corporation,** the communications company, announced last week that it will report earnings on November 4th. However for most investors the results are irrelevant and it is the prospect of a merger with T-Mobile that will ultimately decide the value of Sprint’s stock. 

There are a number of commentators (such as Boost Mobile founder Peter Adderton) saying that Sprint Corporation is going to zero if the planned merger with T-Mobile doesn’t get approved.  On the other hand, with Justice Department approval now in place, significant progress has been made and the primary issue remaining is the multi-state anti-trust lawsuit planned to start on December 9th.  Furthermore, former FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell seems to believe strongly that this attempt to block the deal will fail (see Bloomberg link at bottom of post).

So what are the potential payoffs?  Under the current offer you need 9.75 Sprint stocks to get 1 T-Mobile stock if the merger is approved.  At yesterday’s close you would need $61.43 worth of Sprint stock to swap for $82.47 of T-Mobile stock. That represents a potential upside of 34.3%. However, if the deal fails we are assuming, like Mr Adderton, that you get zero.  On that basis, the implied probability of success of the merger is 43%.

Those who believe that the odds of success are higher, like Mr McDowell seems to, may wish to buy in. But they should understand that they could lose the entire stake if the deal falls through.

**Tupperware Brands** fell sharply on Wednesday after reporting a bad miss. Revenues fell 14% and EPS of $0.43 missed expectations by a whopping 19 cents. But with the stock down 40% this week to $9.71 (and down 85% from 2017 highs) it looks like it may now offer a (risky) opportunity.

Tupperware’s balance sheet looks okay and the lowered guidance of $1.95 (adjusted $2.80) would still be a good result for the company if it manages to deliver.  Even if we assume a worse deterioration with earnings halved to $1.60 the stock still looks reasonably priced.

The problem is challenging headwinds from economic and political concerns to declining relevance. The steps that management have taken to turn the company around don't seem to have worked. Worryingly there has been almost no indication of improvement.

However that is usually the best time to get in to a speculative opportunity.  The potential upside here is that a positive quarter or two could see the stock rise 200% approaching $30 if not higher. The downside is the stock could fall to zero. 

&#x200B;

**Disaster of the week (Grubhub)**

**Grubhub** dropped 43% on Tuesday after guidance for flat revenues proved that any idea that the company possessed powerful double-sided network effects with restaurants and diners was incorrect.  It is a bleak assessment for the industry as a whole but hit Grubhub particularly hard given its high expectations.  In short, network effects appear to be only local and that’s why competitors like DoorDash, Uber Eats, Caviar, and Postmates have been able to carve out market share.

# **Perfect summer storm brewing for stock correction as trade war simmers and more Fed action awaited  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/02/perfect-storm-building-for-market-correction.html)**
*****
> With new risks from trade wars, stocks head into the final weeks of summer vulnerable to a pull back or even correction.
*****
> The market was down sharply in the past week, buffeted first by disappointment over the Fed’s more hawkish-than-expected policy outlook. Then they were beaten down by fears President Donald Trump is starting a new front in the trade wars with China that is unlikely to end any time soon.
*****
> “The real issue as to why there’s going to be a correction in our view is there’s a massive, massive vacuum here,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivative strategy at BTIG. “In essence, it’s a month and a half of a vacuum, if you think about the direction of the rhetoric. ... The issues are China, the issues are the Fed and the issues are Brexit. In the first tow, you’re almost not going to hear anything.”
*****
> Trump, in threatening new tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods on Thursday, said the tariffs would go into effect on Sept. 1 unless China acts, but no new talks are expected before September. Economists said if the tariffs are put in place, the risks of a U.S. recession rise, particularly if businesses step back from investment, and possibly even hiring. But that could also prompt the Fed to cut interest rates to rescue the economy when it meets in September.
*****
> After a deluge of corporate headlines in the past several weeks, the earnings season is also winding down with just about 60 major companies reporting in the week ahead, and there are no really significant economic reports until the middle of the month.
*****
> Emanuel said the S&P 500 could see a decline to about 2,789, though he still expects to see 3,000 at the end of the year. Stocks started the past week near all-time highs, and the S&P 500 was was down more than 3% in the past week, but still up about 17% for the year-to-date. Odds are high that stocks pull back in August, since for the past eight years, the S&P 500 was negative during August in six of them.
*****
> Emanuel said if stocks decline too much or too long, he expects to see some action from the White House that will halt the selling.
*****
> “If you’re the president, there’s no way you’re going to allow an economic slowdown in an election year,” said Emanuel.
*****
> Barry Knapp, managing partner at Ironsides Macroeconomics, said Friday the escalation of the trade wars has made him more risk adverse, and he would lighten up holdings in the sectors he had favored—industrials, technology and transportation stocks.
*****
> “We could have a correction ... then we’ll have to see how the policy makers respond to it,′ Knapp said. “The risks are significant. I think we’ll get a correction. ... We could trade back to the May lows, somewhere around 2,750. then we’ll see how the administration responds. This was a seasonally vulnerable period.”
*****
> The Fed cut its target fed funds rate range Wednesday for the first time in a decade, but it does not have another meeting until Sept. 17, though Fed official hold their annual symposium in Jackson Hole at the end of August.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell disappointed markets when he said the Fed was in a “midcycle adjustment,” not a longer term rate cutting cycle but by Friday, futures markets were indicating a nearly 100% chance the Fed will cut interest rates in September.
*****
> “Clearly from the Fed, you’re going to get silence, until the end of the month in Jackson Hole where you may hear something but nothing of materiality,” said Emanuel. “All the Chinese leadership is by the seaside for the next couple of weeks...what you’re going to get for the next two weeks is next to total silence.”
*****
> Emanuel said Brexit is also a risk for markets, as the U.K. gets closer to the Oct. 31 deadline to leave the European Union. “In all likelihood, if you hear something between now and then, it’s basically going to increase the perception that brinkmanship toward the Oct. 31 deadline becomes more a reality every day, and this is reflected in the fact the British sterling is collapsing,” he said. The market has been speculating that the odds of a hard Brexit are increasing, meaning Britain leaves the EU with no plan.
*****
> Interest rates and currency wars
> Currency markets were volatile in the past week, but the dollar index was basically flat by Friday afternoon. Traders were monitoring both the moves in the foreign exchange market and fixed income markets.
*****
> As for the bond market, the declines in yields in the past week were dramatic, with about a 30 basis point move in the 10-year yield in just two days. Treasury yields were bouncing along 2016 levels. The 10-year moved from about 2.07% ahead of the Fed news to less than 1.85% It was at 1.87% Friday afternoon.
*****
> Yields, which move opposite price, also had moved lower on the Trump trade threats.
*****
> “Now everybody is waiting for the next tweet. Unfortunately, there’s no economics calendar for when those come out,′ said Jon Hill, rate strategist at BMO.
*****
> Hill said traders will be watching the three auctions, $38 billion in 3-year notes Tuesday; a record $27 billion 10-years Wednesday and the record $19 billion 30-year long bond auction, on Thursday.
*****
> Hill said the market will be watching ISM nonmanufacturing data Tuesday to see if the services side of the economy is still holding up. “It’s been a point of continued strength,” he said, noting at the same time manufacturing has been in decline.
*****
> Knapp said he is also worried that the dollar could strengthen on the trade war, and hurt emerging market currencies and U.S. profits. He noted that the Chinese currency weakened against the dollar overnight.
*****
> He said he is concerned currency volatility could “just start to have this big disruption that could be another factor that would just bleed into risk markets like the equity market.”

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 8/2/19

> Economic data may have taken a bit of a backseat amidst the FOMC meeting Wednesday and tariff headlines at the tail end of the week, but the US still had a heavy slate with 38 total releases.

> Data was broadly weaker with almost twice as many releases coming in weaker (20) than stronger (11) relative to forecasts (or the prior release when there was no consensus forecast). The Dallas Fed kicked off the week with a weaker than expected reading on manufacturing activity, but it was an improvement from June’s level of negative 12.1. In other manufacturing data, on Thursday we got Markit and ISM PMIs which were mixed. While Markit was stronger, the headline reading of ISM was weaker; new orders did improve, however. Headline factory orders were also weaker, but excluding transportation they were unchanged. As forecasted, personal income and spending weakened while inflation came in at a slower than expected pace on Tuesday. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence indices were the main bright spot of the week with stronger readings across the board. Claims data continued to show a slower pace of improvement on Thursday as both initial and continuing claims came in above expectations. Meanwhile, Friday’s Nonfarm Payrolls report was the most inline with expectations since October 2012, coming in only 1K below forecasts of 165K.

> Economic data is much lighter next week. The non-manufacturing portions of ISM and Markit PMIs are due on Monday. JOLTS and consumer credit are out on Wednesday. Producer inflation gauges are set to be released Friday.

# Fakeouts

> Throughout the course of the entire year, large caps have been leading the market higher, and they are the only market cap range of the equity market to actually make new highs in the most recent leg higher for equities. After this week's pullback, though, the S&P 500 is coming perilously close to breaking through support at the prior highs from April and last fall. A close below those levels today would not be a great mood-setter for the bulls heading into the weekend.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-SPX.png))**

> For Mid and Small Caps, the picture is even less optimistic. The S&P 400 Mid Cap index never came close to a new high in the most recent rally, but it did appear to break its downtrend from the highs late last year. But that breakout quickly turned to a fakeout this week as the S&P 400 broke back down below its prior downtrend line and is breaking below the 50-DMA today.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-MID.png))**

> For the small-cap Russell 2000, it's an identical picture. In this case, the break above the downtrend line was even more short-lived, and like the S&P 400, the Russell 2000 is not only back below its 50-DMA, but it also isn't that far from breaking below its 200-DMA.

# Earnings Season Déjà Vu

> Is it happening again? After what has to this point been a perfectly good earnings season for the US stock market sending the S&P 500 to new all-time highs in the process, the President spoiled the party yesterday when he tweeted that a new round of tariffs would be instituted on Chinese Imports. Stocks had erased all of their declines from Powell's Wednesday press conference by mid-day Thursday, but then the President’s tweet sent equity markets reeling with the Dow falling more than 1%, while the yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell back below 2%.

> If this whole scenario sounds familiar to you, that’s because we saw the same thing last quarter. Remember back in April when the S&P 500 rallied to new highs in the early weeks of earnings season? There was a feeling then that the market was finally breaking out of its rut and on the path to a sustained breakout. But then over the first weekend of May, on a Sunday afternoon no less, the President sent out a series of tweets outlining his plan for increased tariffs on Chinese imports. The following Monday, the market opened lower and kept falling throughout the month. By the end of May, the S&P 500 was down 6.6% for the month, making it the worst May for the S&P 500 since 2010. August has historically been an iffy month for the stock market as many on Wall Street take vacations and try to relax, but if the market follows the earnings season script from last quarter, this will be an August of little rest.

# President Takes Matters into His Own Hands

> The President has been frustrated with the Federal Reserve’s prior rate hikes and now the lack of a more substantial cut in rates. Just the other day, Trump was quoted as saying, “Obama had zero interest rates, we have ‘normalized’ rates. While the Fed hasn’t helped the President’s cause, he has seemingly taken matters into his own hands with his policy towards China. Each time he ratchets up the rhetoric against China, it tends to put additional downward pressure on interest rates, and following Thursday’s tweets, the yield on the 10-year plummetted below 1.9%.

> Ironically enough, the last time the 10-year yield was this low was on Election Day 2016. While short-term borrowing costs are up as the FOMC has hiked rates during Trump's time in office, the yield on the 10-year isn’t much different. Under the eight years of President Obama, the yield on the 10-year averaged 2.47%, while under Trump the average yield has been 2.57%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-10-Year-Yield.png))**

> The chart below shows a shorter-term look at the 10-year yield over the last year and it has practically been in free-fall the entire time. Ever since late 2018, every time the yield has attempted to make a move above its 50-DMA, it has reversed lower, with the most recent leg lower in May coinciding with another series of tweets concerning tariffs on Chinese goods.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080119-10YR-Yield.png))**

> While not a lot of stocks have benefitted from the President’s policy tweets on Chinese tariffs, the impact of lower interest rates has been cheered on by the homebuilders as they have practically been a completely inverse image of the move in rates. Just yesterday, the group hit a new high before pulling back a bit, but lower long-term interest rates mean lower mortgage payments, and that helps to make housing more affordable for millions of millennials looking for a place of their own.

# Outside Day for Gold (GLD)

> Even though assets have been selling off across the board in response to Wednesday's Fed decision and the President's announcement of increased tariffs yesterday, there is one bullish point to be found. Yesterday, gold (GLD) had initially moved slightly lower around the open but then surged into the close, finishing the day only a couple of cents off of the intraday high. Not only did GLD fully recoup the morning's losses, but it also gained back the previous day's losses and then some. This outside day/bullish engulfing pattern is typically seen as a bullish technical signal.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GLD.png))**

> This pattern has occurred a total of 35 times in the history of the Gold ETF (GLD). Below we show the 10 previous times that this pattern was observed after not having occurred in the previous six months. Despite being a bullish setup, performance in the next week has actually had a negative bias with an average return of -0.57%. The past five times have seen a loss in the following week. Likewise, three months out sees better than average returns but the probability of GLD trading higher is the just the same as a coinflip. But, generally, in the months and year after, GLD continues to trend higher on average with more consistent gains in the next month, 6 months, and year periods. Returns are also better than normal across these time frames.

# Solid Jobs Growth in July

> The job market continues to be a pillar of strength for the U.S. economy.

> Nonfarm payrolls rose 164,000 in July, in line with consensus estimates for a 165,000 gain, according to the jobs report released August 2. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Solid Jobs Growth in July, job creation has slowed slightly this year amid the aging economic expansion, but not to levels that concern us. The 12-month average payrolls gain through July was 187,000, still an above-average pace for the expansion.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NSNykYz.png))**

> Strength in the job market is especially important these days as U.S. consumers increasingly bear the weight of economic growth. Consumer activity added 2.9 percentage points to second quarter gross domestic product (GDP), carrying GDP growth to 2.1%.

> Initial jobless claims, a leading economic indicator, have also pointed to firm labor-market conditions. The four-week average for unemployment claims fell to the fifth-lowest level of the expansion through July 26.

> “We’ve been encouraged by the labor market’s resiliency amid recent global uncertainty,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “A solid labor market should continue to bolster consumer confidence and buoy economic activity.”

> Average hourly earnings grew 3.2% year over year in July, a faster pace than June’s growth and at a healthy clip for the U.S. consumer. Wages constitute about 70% of business costs, so we’re hoping meaningful pay increases will eventually help lift consumer inflation, countering weakness in global demand. The unemployment rate climbed to 3.7%, still near a cycle low.

# August: Better in Pre-Election Years, But Still Not Great

> Money flows from harvesting made August a great stock market month in the first half of the Twentieth Century. It was the best month from 1901 to 1951. In 1900, 37.5% of the population was farming. Now that less than 2% farm, August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 31 years, 1988-2018 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.

> In pre-election years since 1950, Augusts’ rankings improve modestly: #7 DJIA, #8 S&P 500, #10 NASDAQ (since 1971), #9 Russell 1000 and #10 Russell 2000 (since 1979). Average performance in pre-election years is positive except for Russell 2000 which is unchanged.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2c259751b53bc3c3005d4c266dd9fac/b4aa95c4256eed3a-ce/s400x600/345335a8152d24b9b10af91f813c9bf07af456fe.jpg))**

> Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011 and 2013 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts’ average decline. A strong August in 2014 of S&P 3.8% and NASDAQ 4.8% preceded corrections of 7.4% and 8.4% respectively from mid-September to mid-October.

- No, you shouldn't buy into cruises.
- No, you shouldn't gamble on which biotech stock will come up with the Covid vaccine.
- Maybe you can slowly invest into airlines, after reading a lot and understanding their financials and risks.

Also, nobody knows where the bottom is, when we will get back up, which companies will stay afloat and which will go under. 

That's why, in an uncertain market, you invest in funds or blue chip stocks. This is not easy and fast money because the market has fallen down. It's an opportunity to get the big stable companies at a decent rate. You can play around with penny stocks as much as you like when the market is stable and growing.

ANSWERED,412,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/8lb6h9/how_to_find_smaller_companies_with_higher_growth/,65,"I wrote this long comment answering OP, but before I got the chance he deleted it, but here's what I had to say:


Use a screener like finviz. Look for companies that have sales q/q 30% or more and gross margin over 40% (ideally over 80%, but new stocks closer to their IPO might have extremely low gross margin, but if they can keep growing their sales and EPS, then gross margin will improve and the stock price will keep rising). FB had phenomenal fundamentals for almost the entire time it's been trading publicly.

EPS q/q should be positive, but it depends, sometimes high growth means spending a lot in the beginning, but if this is an old stock, years after IPO, then stay way from negative EPS growth, old companies should have 15 to 30% EPS growth Q/Q like ZNGA. If it's reverse, negative sales and positive EPS and negative ROI like GPRO, you know something is wrong.

Look for market caps over $2 billion and don't be tempted in buying micro caps (under $300 million).

Lastly institutional ownership below 75%, if it's already over, it could still be a good stock, but you're looking for smaller companies that institutions haven't completely gobbled up yet; same is true for large stocks. Institutional buying is like fuel that keeps stocks going. Likewise, don't bother with near 100% institutional ownership since those stocks will just get sold off by institutions when the stock goes through bad times, Pandora comes to mind when it was completely owned by institutions.

So yeah, that's what I wanted to say, if you have a different strategy, please share it thanks.

N95 respirator masks DO HELP 

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirator-use-faq.html

""What is an N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR)?

An N95 FFR is a type of respirator which removes particles from the air that are breathed through it. These respirators filter out at least 95% of very small (0.3 micron) particles. N95 FFRs are capable of filtering out all types of particles, including bacteria and viruses.

What makes N95 respirators different from facemasks (sometimes called a surgical mask)?

Infographic: Understanding the difference between surgical masks and N95 respiratorspdf icon

N95 respirators reduce the wearer’s exposure to airborne particles, from small particle aerosols to large droplets. N95 respirators are tight-fitting respirators that filter out at least 95% of particles in the air, including large and small particles.""

Here's what's happening. 

1. Hospital staff need these respirator masks A LOT MORE than the average person does. It means the government should have already placed the orders before the virus reaches their  country. The problem right now is extreme demand, not that people are buying ineffective protective equipment.   



2. This virus usually enters via mouth, nose and eyes via droplets from people's mouth and nose while breathing, talking, sneezing, coughing. To realise the maximum effectiveness that the N95 respirators can achieve, you have to wear goggles also. Even glasses will help a bit, unless of course a virus containing droplet reaches your eyes from the side.   



3.  Surgical masks effectiveness is indeed much lower, since they can only stop  large droplets but not smaller ones and they leave gaps from the side.   



4. For the above reasons, the US gov came to an agreement with manufactures to dramatically increase supply of those respirators and possibly other masks. The demand will only get higher, health services alone will need millions upon millions according to the gov's statements about stocking up yesterday.   



5. APT makes their masks profit precisely from N95 respirators which also happen to be higher margin products for them (and I mean even without the price spikes). The announcements they made already about increased orders, concern the N95 respirator masks specifically.    

*** as correctly pointed out by  u/WaxuTutu, technically it is the N95 respirators (not masks) that work as described in the post. The APT N95 is in fact an N95 respirator (basically it means that this is a mask that fits air tight and has a specific filter, but that is the actual description of the product). The text above was edited accordingly.

The latest series that I have put out is [Python for Finance](https://pythonprogramming.net/getting-stock-prices-python-programming-for-finance/). The aim of this series is to show what can be done with Python in the field of finance and algorithmic trading using data science (spoiler alert: a lot!). 

Even though you probably aren’t going to get rich, you might save yourself a lot of money (when you back test your silly trading idea and realize it’s bad), and you’ll learn about statistics and data science with Python along the way. 

I start the series off with a simplistic introduction to using Python+[Pandas](https://pythonprogramming.net/data-analysis-python-pandas-tutorial-introduction/)+[Matplotlib](https://pythonprogramming.net/matplotlib-intro-tutorial/)  to get stock data, visualize stock data, and to manipulate this data. 

From here, we get into Quantopian, which is a Python-based platform built on top of the Zipline library for back-testing, but has since expanded out to enable quite a bit more than that.

We use Quantopian both for simplistic back testing, but also for doing research into future trading strategies, since Quantopian also provides a bunch of free data like minute pricing data, fundamentals along with tools like [Alphalens](https://github.com/quantopian/alphalens) for analyzing various factors that you believe to be beneficial to a trading strategy.

I know AMC has a relatively high SI % float, but with the unfolding of a certain stock ,

1. Can large hedge funds/shorters /MMs somehow take a certain course of action to ensure a suppressed squeeze? Is there any possibility ?

2. Also, what are the potential downsides of going into AMC? 

I read the DDs on a certain subreddit about their consistent revenue growth etc. , but they plummeted abit before COVID started and went all the way down during COVID. I can only think of AMC declining if WANDA decides to bail out but given 20% ownership I don’t think so...

A bit about me to give context and the reason I’m posting this. I’m 67 years old, former lawyer situated in Monaco. I retired at 50. I’ve invested my money and I’m worth around let’s say $100 mln? I. Honestly don’t know. I’ve got around $60 mln in my portfolio. Mostly ETFs for high liquidity and safety. I’m a strong defender of long term investments. And that’s the reason why I’m posting. People are scared when they see red. I would like to inspire and explain why you shouldn’t be worried about losses. (If you invest long term). And my example is extrem but that might underline how important it is to hold. See I made $20 mln in 2020. So losing even ten million wouldn’t matter to me. In fifteen years I’ll be green. Sure this isn’t quick money but it’s easy and stable. And you can always trade with pocket-money. I wanted to add a picture of my portfolio to give this post a more theatrical vibe but I’m to old to figure that out. Well I guess I’m trying to give an advice, don’t sell if you lose a bit don’t be scared. You will archive gains if you wait long enough. People always talk about becoming a millionaire overnight. And that’s just dreams. But becoming a millionaire in 35 years isn’t. Anyways excuse me for making a clickbait title but getting the message out is important to me. I really love this community and even though I’m old I was welcomed so nicely. And I meet so many youngsters who searched advice. Love you ❤️ (also I don’t know if the flair is right but I’m counting this as advice.) I got a photo in the comments now. Figured it out :)",2020-09-24 09:13:22
1931,Post your 2020 Picks for 2030 and reasoning behind them,409,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/e9edxl/post_your_2020_picks_for_2030_and_reasoning/,245,"Like the title says, post your picks for 2020 that you will hold til 2030. 

Let's rewind to December of 2009. FB is not yet public. TWTR's tweets are still petite and the stock is unlisted. GOOG is back at $300 for the first time since its pre-recession peak. AAPL is also nearly back at $30, returning to pre-recession highs. MSFT is also at $30, where it has been stagnant since falling after its monopoly-esque problems. 

Fast forward to 2019. FB is at $200. TWTR is now listed and at $30, down from its IPO and recent highs near $45. GOOG is now at $1345. AAPL is $280. And MSFT is $151. Hot damn. Had you been holding since 12/2009, you would have made quite a return on any of these giants.

Internet consumption tripled from 50 minutes to 157 minutes from 2009 to 2019. TV dropped from 187 minutes to 163. 

But this major shift is IMO what is driving the internet boom. 

So what does this mean for 2030? What stocks should we pick now for 4-10X return in 10 years? 

I think the trend from 2009-2019 will continue through to 2029 even if the relative gains of internet consumption decrease. There is still XX time elsewhere to cannibalize, on TOP of 163 minutes of daily TV time. 

That internet time consumed by average person has tripled, and that the companies that benefit from this have more than tripled, belies the importance of media consumption and the tech revolution as we look forward to 2029. So to that end, what will still be around in 2029, what will be more consumed, what will be more profitable, and what will people be DOING more than today?

I think the 107 minute per day gain in media is going to hold over the next ten years re: internet use. As people have more free time in general due to the proliferation of the gig economy (tech insecurity = semi-unemployment / gig economy = media use in off time, besides increasing media use in general), FB, TWTR, GOOG are only going to become more engrained into society's everyday functioning. 

I am currently long on FB, and I think TWTR will be the next addition due to its recent drop. TWTR was tracking FB nicely post-2018 correction, and I believe the current price offers an entry target that is substantially undervalued. 

I see 2020 offering a major boon to both companies as election attention ramps up. TWTR will be a bigger name than ever this cycle as it plays out on the internet vs. TV more than any previous cycle (a trend that will only continue in 2024 and 2028). While concerns about FB's reach exist, I do not think they will result in a break-up as long as TWTR survives, as it removes the claims of monopoly. So TWTR's survival is actually also in FB's interest and as it survives it will only become more ubiquitous now that it is profitable. 

I think MSFT and AAPL and GOOG are probably great bets for 2029 as well, but I love FB and TWTR's potential over the next 10 years and would argue FB in particular could be like AAPL around 2009 in terms of impending growth. TWTR could be more of a GOOG. But both offer major return potential. 

Looking ten years ahead, what are your picks, why are the above picks wrong, ETC? :)

I also like ADBE ($37 in 12/2019 to $303 today), Cloudflare aka NET (IPO @$18, waiting til lockup to consider buying but I love it), OHI (Omega Healthcare, $19 in 09 to $42 today with big dividend), and maybe UBER next year.",2019-12-12 09:29:38

I’m just trying to get some help understanding the macro-economic factors that could lead to this seemingly impossible situation. 

Live Nation is one of the largest live event promoters in the world. They own Ticketmaster and a slew of live event venues across the world. Due to the pandemic, their business has essentially ground to a halt with revenues down over 95% YoY. Despite this, their stock price is currently trading at or above their pre-pandemic levels.

The company has a significant amount of cash on hand at 2.63B with a quarterly burn around 500M. So it is unlikely the company will completely fold unless the pandemic is extended for many years. But still, I don’t understand how the valuation of this company by the market could be so high. Once live events do come back, wouldn’t the company be in a significantly worse financial position than before pandemic because of the huge amount of cash burned? Wouldn’t it make sense for this weaker future position to be priced into the stock now?

Sorry for the potentially dumb question. I’m new to investing and can’t really wrap my head around this one. What do people see in this stock that I am missing?

1936,The state of this sub at the moment,402,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hx6v21/the_state_of_this_sub_at_the_moment/,148,"I’ve been a lurker in this sub for a long long while now and don’t contribute too much but always enjoyed the content posted here - nothing overly serious but never stepping over the line into r/wallstreetbets. There was often some light due diligence, key news which would impact the markets/a particular stock, and some intelligent discussion on equities.

Over the past couple of months though, since the market rebound, the quality of content here, in my opinion, has massively declined.

90% of the posts here now are something along the lines of “opinions on TSLA?!” or “AMD is holding up my portfolio” or “is now a good time to buy NIO?”. To my interpretation, this is allowed in the rules but this is really what the pinned Daily Discussion should be used for. There should be a rule enforcing this, and mods should be removing posts which break this rule.

The other 10% of posts at the moment, especially in the last week which has been red, have been along the lines of “stay strong, don’t sell today, take some time out” or “what happened, I left the house, came back an hour later and TSLA is down 1%?!”. Personally after coming through several -7%+ days in March, I just find these irritating. r/stocks always seemed to be about returning long term gains, not worrying about day fluctuations.

I understand that at the moment this sub has a large number of new investors learning the ropes, but there needs to be more structure in my opinion. Arguably the chaos which is going on is likely not helping these new investors to be successful.

1938,TSLA valuation,402,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hiodo8/tsla_valuation/,382,"This is a topic that has already been milked alot but I want to talk about it.

TSLA's book value is 6B, revenue is currently negative but it's not important bc it's a very small number compared to their cash.

The fact is that it currently has a market cap of 197B, so if hypothetically their debts disappear they got a book value of 32B, let's add another 20B for their brand so 52B, let's also say that their profit quadruples to 16B instantly, now it's fairly priced or even a bit undervalued if you use discounted cash flow as a method of evaluation.

But I dont think this is such a realistic view, I think Teslas will be widely used in the future and in years it will become a commonly used car not a rare/luxury one, but it's not an instant thing like in my example.

But it's possible that in years they quadruple their sales and so their profit, but that kind of advance is more or less already priced in the current price.

I think if you buy now and hold it for decades (as you should do when you are investing) you will see a profit, but there's not a margin of safety and that cash would be better spent elsewhere where it would have better returns.",2020-07-01 01:28:20

They could afford it and if they were successful, the ad revenue would become a significant part of their business.

Hey all,

I know some of the members in the group prefer to work in Excel (including myself) so I created a spreadsheet that looks at trending symbols and estimates bullish/bearish sentiment.

2. Blockspring Add-in (can download from within sheet)

3. A StockTwits account (Free)

**What it pulls:**

- Trending Symbols (30 at a time)

- Historical Price Data (Up to 5 years)

- Recent News

- Recent Tweets

- Bullish/Bearish Sentiment of recent tweets

Hoping this is something that is useful to the group, and I am more than happy to help peeps setup the sheet so they can use it. Just send me a message on here or to my inbox.

This will continue until for possibly weeks (or months) until it eventually shakes off everyone who is itching it leave. That is when organic growth can begin. Once it reaches a new ATH it will be ready to take off again. Not like it has in the past, but in a real way.

Enjoy the rollercoaster and congrats for picking a winning company.",2020-12-03 11:09:52

- This letter is the latest of many sent to the Trump administration by Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, the national campaign against tariffs supported by more than 150 trade groups representing agriculture, manufacturing, retail and tech industries.


- Sources have told Reuters there has been little preparation for a meeting even as the health of the world economy is at stake.


- Additional 25% tariffs on $300 billion in imports, on top of those already levied, would wipe out more than 2 million U.S. jobs, the letter said, citing estimates from international consultancy the Trade Partnership.


- They would also add more than $2,000 in costs for the average American family of four and reduce the value of U.S. Gross Domestic Product by 1%, it said.

But singlehandedly turning around a stock despite the efforts of a massive investment company? Congratulations, I never thought I’d see the day.

In one sentence a TML is an institutional quality stock in a leading industry group with superior fundamentals and technicals. These are monster stocks which over the course of weeks and months increase +100% to +5,000% . These stocks are disruptors which change how we work, live, or play.

TMLs are popular with traders/investors whose methodology is based on the CANSLIM system developed by William O'Neil. He called them Model Book Stocks. Huge winners worth studying to identify common characteristics that they all share  O'Neil studied over 1000 model book stocks going back to the 1880s. Many are shown and discussed in these must read books

Yahoo 1996 [https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ](https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ)

**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**

* Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY
* Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY
* Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters
* ROE >17%
* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25%

And above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service  that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.

TMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)

Additionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume > $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.

**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**

They should be:

* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average
* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base
* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)
* Volume and Price contractions within bases
* Up/Down Vol> 1.2
* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat
* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.

During corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages.  They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling ""Buy me"".  And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.

**So how to scan for them:**

Use MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA.  It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.

1967,"Amazon Stock Price Target Prediction & Analysis [DCF, Fundamental & Tehnical]",392,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ky3nxo/amazon_stock_price_target_prediction_analysis_dcf/,123,"**Should you buy Amazon stock or has it run out of growth opportunities? What is my price prediction for Amazon? Read until the end of the post as I reveal my price target for Amazon and why I believe it can deliver insane returns!**

**\~Warning! Very Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and welcome to another stock price prediction! Today we are going to talk about Amazon and what’s the upside for the company! So, let’s go over the company a little before moving on to some fundamental, technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years & months.

So, let’s start by talking a little about [Amazon](https://ibb.co/47vPnY2), yeah, I know it’s one of the biggest companies in the world, but I believe Amazon is still undervalued & underappreciated compared to some of the highflyers that have generate insane returns in the past months, though most of them are still far from profitability and don’t have the growth across all the board like Amazon.

Maybe the market doesn't put as much attention in the numbers as I do but I would rather invest in a business which I consider to be healthy and growing rather than a what if stock like many of the recent inflated IPOs. Amazon is a trillion-dollar company growing at a double-digit pace as many companies that are a fraction of their size would kill for this numbers, but this hasn’t helped Amazon since September.

On a global scale e-commerce is expected to increase from 16% to 22% of retail sales by 2023. With the U.S. expected to increase its retail e-commerce sales from $374 billion to $476 billion by 2024.This is another thing that supports the growth that e-commerce has in front of it, both as total and as a % of the total retail sales. With the latest [report](https://ibb.co/jRMvB7x) showing a 24% increase in holiday e-commerce transactions and a 19% increase for the 2020 fiscal year.

E-commerce is showing signs that it will continue to gain share of the total market as a recent report projects that digital sales during the Black Friday-to-Cyber Monday period will grow by about 35% YOY, reaching [penetration](https://ibb.co/3StWbwz) of around 32% and growing by more 10B, as this continues to eat up market share from more traditional B&M retailers.

I think one of the biggest problems the company has, it’s the actual share price of the company, not the value. We have seen that a stock split can and will attract more buyers and the share price would probably see an accelerated rate of growth, just look at what happened with Tesla and Apple [recently](https://ibb.co/GFqGsjV). By splitting the stock just like [Apple](https://ibb.co/d766wL5) has done a number of times, this allows more individual investors to invest in the company, as they will be attracted by the cheaper share price. [Amazon](https://ibb.co/XStd5Jf) hasn’t done a share split since the dot com era, and it might be time for the company to take advantage of this hot bull market to actually go ahead with something like at least a 5-10:1 split.

So, let’s go a little through the latest quarter [results](https://ibb.co/Y8JHWdc) and [guidance](https://ibb.co/mCT3T43). The company increased the operating cash flow by more than 55% to over $55B for the latest twelve months, with free cash flow also increasing by $6B, while they managed to avoid significant [dilution](https://ibb.co/6bYCLhx) of the company, with only 7M additional shares being outstanding.

The net sales also increased 37% in the last quarter to just over $96B, an increase of more than $26B over 2019, which is an insane 36% increase y/y yet again.

This year Amazon has also pushed their [Prime Day](https://ibb.co/1RPqhMv) ahead of schedule, which resulted in the two biggest days ever for third-party small & medium sellers, which saw an increase in sales of over 60% over 2019, even bigger than Amazon own retail business.

Amazon continues to expand into multiple revenue streams, with the first Amazon [Fresh](https://ibb.co/9ZBqwKM) grocery store opened in California, which is offering both in-store and online products.

We also saw Amazon’s more profitable revenue streams meaning the services revenues increasing, with Amazon Studios continuing to produce original movies and TV-series while also expanding their offering to live sport games.

The company is also seeking to expand into the red-hot Video Gaming market, as they launched a new service Prime Gaming, available for free for Prime Members and also announced Luna which will be a cloud gaming service that will allow customers to play high-quality games on previously owned devices, thus not requiring bigger investments for many customers. They also continued to improve their [devices](https://ibb.co/VVkyDXX) like the Echo, Alexa, Ring and FireTV line of products, which feature more & more AI Improvements.

Amazon has also announced an expansion into the pharmacy business which put a lot of pressure on traditional pharmacy companies like CVS & Walgreens, while also announcing a new Halo service, aimed at helping customers improve their lifestyle.

I like companies that make me a lot of money, but I also like that they are [involved](https://ibb.co/r7C6NXs) in projects aimed at helping poorer communities around the world, with their latest Project Kuiper, being a low-earth orbit satellite constellation that is aiming to provide reliable & cheap internet access around the world.

And last but not least, let’s not forget about the biggest income provider as margin goes, the Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://ibb.co/MkHgG7d)). Amazon continued to see significant customer demand for this product with multiple big companies like Global Payments & Moderna using their services. Alongside these 2 companies we also saw AWS providing even more data services for the [NFL](https://ibb.co/zbYySCp) and many more other companies. AWS has been a terrific revenue stream for Amazon, with [AWS](https://ibb.co/87614m9) having 1/3 of the market share for cloud infrastructure in the first half of 2020, as the compound annual growth of AWS has been 40% in the recent years, just below the other profitable [services](https://ibb.co/0Byn2R7) they offer on subscriptions services, advertising & payments, with the only revenue stream seeing a negative growth being the physical stores.

Overall, the company has seen a 28% compound annual [growth](https://ibb.co/mCwDCTb) in revenues since 2016 and an even bigger 68% [growth](https://ibb.co/jk57Qq9) in earnings/share, which is incredible to say the least.

So, before even starting, you should now that I am bull on Amazon but I am willing to hear other opinions so don’t be afraid to leave a comment down below!

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on…

Firstly, let’s start with the Guidance that Amazon gave us for the 4th quarter, as they are expecting net sales between $112B and $121B implying a growth of between 28-38% over 2019. They also provided guidance for the operating income but this is heavily impacted by the problems we had in 2020 and that still continue to be around.

The company also is aiming to [optimize](https://ibb.co/0ZTfncc) the free cash flow which was up 26% y/y for Q3, as they are trying to dilute the shares as little as possible. The total net [SALES](https://ibb.co/7jsRCN5) for the last twelve months is nearing $348B which even adjusted for forex is still up 31%. Amazon has only 12% of their revenues coming the AWS right now, but this is by far the most profitable revenue for the company, as the increases in AWS sales have led to an over 90% [increase](https://ibb.co/ts6VKrb) in operating income from the previous year.

Let’s take a look at the last quarter’s results. We saw a big [INCREASE](https://ibb.co/qrpk3wR) in all 3 big revenue streams for Amazon, with the first 9 months of 2020 brining over $160B in sales in North America, $67B from International sales and almost $33B from AWS. For my [projections](https://ibb.co/4FCPJ8N) I actually just added another quarter like this one to the end results, which actually is a conservative estimate of $96B compared to the guidance of $112B, and the growth rate that Amazon’s net sales has seen in the past year, with North America Sales rising by 37%, International by 31% and AWS by 30%.

For the cost of sales, I did pretty much the same, and with cost [margin](https://ibb.co/wcP1Wrj) standing at 75% of net sales for the last quarters I think this is pretty safe to say it will remain mostly the same if not even improve due to bigger revenues from the AWS. I also estimated the full yearly costs by adding another identical quarter, just like for the revenues, so that things stay even.

For the other operating expenses, I also took this from their financials as I expect both [SG&A](https://ibb.co/QN7YWxQ) and [R&D](https://ibb.co/DwmXmsK) expenses to start to normalize a little after the huge spending to ramp up capacity this year due to the increase in demand, while I also did the same thing for the [Capex](https://ibb.co/f0dSK7B) spending of Amazon, as they have invested massively in the last 12 months to ramp up things.

Meanwhile for the interest [income](https://ibb.co/rdc1HRZ) and expenses I also just averaged things out for the full year while maintaining the other sources of income, but these have such a small impact that they don’t even matter.

Amazon has had a pretty wild effective [TAX RATE](https://ibb.co/N3vtKJn) in the past decade, but I decided to see what the avg was for the last 4years, and that was 16%, but for safety and due to the change in administration in the US I decided to bump this up a little to 18%.

And one last number that is important is [THE](https://ibb.co/SnQGLXT) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which has seen a 36% increase y/y for since 2016.

So, let’s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [PROJECTIONS](https://ibb.co/89jHggN), though this is not my favorite type of projections we will get to that very soon.

I used the trailing Twelve-month EBITA (which means Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation & Amortization) and assumed a growth starting from of 15% in 2021 and slightly lower each year ending with a 10% growth for EBITA in 2025. EBIT is calculate after subtracting the depreciation and amortization costs from the EBITA for which I implied an annual increase of 10% so it keeps the pace with the EBITA. I used my projection of the effective tax rate of the company of 18%, which is 2% above the last 4 years avg. NWC is the net working capital of the company and it can be summed up in 2 ways, the simpler method is current assets – current liabilities or you can use the more complex formula which I have used which is made up of the total amount of cash & cash equivalents, market investments, trade accounts receivable and inventory from which you subtract the trade accounts payable, so this is the formula I used for this DCF. I also implied the same 10% growth for this, as the company will become even more solvent overtime I estimate. And last but not least I implied a 10% growth for Capital Expenditure as well, which seems pretty reasonable despite this level being very high due to the rapid growth of the company.

Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for this company I think the growth approach is better suited as you will see with my other method, which will show close results to growth approach.

So, this means we have an estimated $584B worth of FCF for a 10% discount rate, which I believe can be even lower for Amazon, but just to be conservative let’s use this 10% rate for the next 5 years. I also assumed the company will continue to grow at a 5% rate after 2025, and that would mean that Amazon will be worth over $3T by 2025, which is mind blowing. So, let’s do the math, with an estimated diluted share count of 531M, that would mean a stock price of $5732 and would imply a return of 83% by 2025. This are insanely huge numbers so let’s take a look at the EBITDA approach also. The nominal value for the EBITDA multiple is usually 25, so, with this multiple, the company would only be worth $3200, that would be only a 2.6% gain from where it is now. If you do want to be conservative you can also do an average of this and the average price would be $4470, with an average return of 43%, which would be pretty much in line with the annual SP500 growth. You can also check and do your own multiple valuation of the company, for example with Amazon right now has been trading at very high EBITDA multiple until recently, so if you use a 50x [multiple](https://ibb.co/VWDxGcg), the actual projections of the stock would be very close, with 71% return for the EBITDA approach and a 77% upside on average, but I think now is the time we move on to my favorite valuation approach, which is not the DCF method.

I like to value companies based on multiples of future price earnings. So, let’s take a look at what Amazon earnings/share will be by 2025.

I implied for the 3 main streams of [revenues](https://ibb.co/KVnYyqC) which are North American Sales, International Sales and AWS sales a rate of growth similar to the one we had this year but with gradual declines each subsequent year. I also used pretty much the same average [cost of sales](https://ibb.co/3sv40Sf) which includes the actual cost of sales and the fulfillment costs. This has stood at about 75% of the net revenues for the past years and might actually improve, but I do want to stay on the safe side. So, by 2025 the gross [REVENUES](https://ibb.co/xSdQX9P) should reach around $244B, assuming margins stay pretty much in line, though it’s likely they will improve margins, with International sales becoming a little more profitable and AWS brining more & more money.

We also have to estimated what the Capex & Operating [expenses](https://ibb.co/HHM0PfS) would be by 2025. I think Amazon should see somewhat of a slowdown of Capex, R&D & SG&A spending, as they have seen a huge boost in the past year, and I think it should normalize, so I will imply an 8% annual growth for these, which is still very high.

[Next](https://ibb.co/F75r4jN), we look at the interest income, expense and other losses or incomes for the company. This numbers are small compared to the vast cash flows of the company that they can even be ignored, but let’s assume they see a 10% decrease both in income and expenses related to interest while also not suffering losses but having a smaller other income by 10%/year. This would results in an almost $114B income pre-tax for 2025.

As I showed you earlier, the effective tax rate for Amazon has been around 16% in the past 4 years, despite the nominal US tax rate. For safety reasons I will use an 18% tax rate, though this should stay closers to 16% on the back of the International taxes. So, with an 18% tax rate, the [FINAL](https://ibb.co/d7ZCstY) income for the company after everything has been taken into consideration should be $93.25B.

For the outstanding [shares](https://ibb.co/x33HyxP), I will be conservative and imply a .5% increase in outstanding shares, as the company has been very careful in avoiding the dilution of the stock. So, with that increase by 2025, we should have around 531M shares.

So, [BASED](https://ibb.co/282sK42) on Price to Future Earnings/share we can see Amazon is currently trading at almost 18 times 2025 earnings/share, which compared to the 90 multiple it’s trading right now would be insanely low. I can see Amazon continuing to trade at very high P/E for the foreseeable future. So, with a 25 PE price the company should trade at 4400$, while with a 50 PE ratio, the stock should be close to 9000$/share, which is insane when you think about that number, but maybe Bezos will listen and split the shares finally.

[Compare](https://ibb.co/ChhMP6Z) this to the [DCF](https://ibb.co/1TM7FWd) valuation and you see that the Perpetuity approach is similar to a 35 PE ratio, while the AVG approach is similar to a 25 PE Ratio, which I don’t expect Amazon to trade at, not even in 5 years.

So, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [HERE](https://ibb.co/2d2KPV4) are my actual price targets… I think the bear case 2025 price we can see Amazon trade at is $4828 which would imply a return of over 54%, while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Amazon will trade at 6145$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 96.5% return on the [current price](https://ibb.co/FwrMhnY). My most bullish case though is $7900, which would imply a return of 152%, with that number being mind-blowing given the current valuation of the company… but I guess we do have to start getting used with such high numbers… I guess decades ago when we saw the first millionaire or billionaire, people would have also thought that it was crazy… but crazy is for the limited minds only I believe.

So yeah guys, here is my [OVERALL](https://ibb.co/XF5h87q) price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 & 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 40 PE’s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 40-50.

So [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O_rAl569qptpB1n1k6hpLLdOroX045_JDHrXLj81-u0/edit) is the full spreadsheet that I have projected for Amazon by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just look at the growth Amazon has in the past. The company has increased in [value](https://ibb.co/QpDg4mp) by more 450% in just the past 5 years and is over 160.000% up since it started [trading](https://ibb.co/KyDzqWq). So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against one of the biggest and fastest growing companies in the world?

The company also has pristine [FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/Bgxf91m), with more than $112B in current assets vs only $102B in current liabilities, with over $282B in total assets. So, the company is way more than solvable at any point in the near future.

And let’s also take a look at what the estimates are from the analysts. We can see that the analysts expect a similar [EPS](https://ibb.co/R48nrDF) by 2025, of around $166 compared to $171/shares that my Growth Valuations are projecting. So, it seems that this could be a very reasonable upside for the company.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Amazon?

Let’s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/kHwWq4x), so starting with the high the stock made before the September sell-off. The stock has been trading in this wedge formation for the last couple of months with increasingly higher lows. The stock isn’t overbought and hasn’t been since it saw an RSI of 73 when it reached the all-time highs. I think with this wedge formation building up, with increasing higher lows and with the pattern of trading likely being an Elliot Theory 5 [WAVE](https://ibb.co/MBqPyc2) formation, I think it’s very likely we see a breakout in the near future, maybe just before earnings, and I expect this breakout to mimic the last run the stock had of about 23% up. So, with that 23% increase mirrored that would result the stock should peak around $[3900](https://ibb.co/VBpRv6j), which I expect to see by the end of the year.

And let’s take a quick look at what 47 [analysts](https://ibb.co/YT0BPTP) on wall street are saying. They are mostly very bullish on the company with an average price target of $3800 and a high price target of $4600 which is insane for a return in the next 12 months, as 46 of the 47 analysts are either bullish or very bullish on Amazon. So yet again, the $3900 isn’t that out of possibilities even as Wall Street’s analysts expect

So, what would I do? Well, I own Amazon stock and I believe it still has tremendous room to grow, so I would start building a position as I expect the company to resume its uptrend sooner rather than later and the next catalyst may be just a couple of weeks away with the last quarter [earnings](https://ibb.co/nLhCJpk) expected to be announced by the end of January.

And I shouldn’t forget to mention that I believe Amazon is one of the most stable stocks out with very good [leadership](https://ibb.co/7KS3yS6), and with large institutional [holders](https://ibb.co/8Dj1W3C) like Vanguard, BlackRock and Morgan Stanley owning huge amounts of the company.

So, [THIS](https://ibb.co/2d2KPV4) are my projections and my expectations for the company, and if you do want to check out the spreadsheets you can find the link [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O_rAl569qptpB1n1k6hpLLdOroX045_JDHrXLj81-u0/)

1971,"Taking out Profits and Exit Strategies, a short story (and perhaps some advice)",388,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k5a8ju/taking_out_profits_and_exit_strategies_a_short/,125,"&#x200B;

In the late 90's we had a similar Tech/Digital stock rally. Back then it was web page development and internet providers, now it's electric vehicles and big data. ""Stonks"" were only going up, up and up. You heard things like - Dude, its a new economy, this is the new normal. This is the future, you can't use old models to define value. Die all boomers and burn traditional stocks (ok I might be exaggerating on this one)

&#x200B;

Anyway, I was a finance major at a prominent university in London, UK. I was destined for greatness (and an trainee spot at Deutche Bank's analyst desk). My friend - let's call him Eli, because his name was actually Eli - was a stock genius. Everybody is a genious in a bull market, put some money in to a company in IT and bam! You had LOL GAINS. Eli was good for about 350kUSD at one point. Or I should say, 350kUSD nominal value in stocks. Because, its not money until you sell. Eli learned the hard way.

&#x200B;

The ""dip"" came. Eli thought ""stonks only go up"" I'm gonna ""buy the dip"". Eli bought and bought, he also had a debt position of about 25% of his portfolio. This increased to 50%. The bank called, Hey Eli - that collateral isn't so hot anymore, pay up dude. Eli paid up. One year later he had -13kUSD on his account for accrued interest rates and trading fees.

&#x200B;

So what's there to learn. Well, depends on how risk averse you are, but I see a lot of new investors that ask about when and how to take home profits. There is no rule or best practice, but here's at least an idea that I'm using myself.

&#x200B;

1. I don't let a stock grow beyond 20% of my portolio, if it does I automatically start scaling back profits
2. I always keep a 10-15% cash position so I can take advantage on dips or other opportunities. This money has had a ridicoulus payback over the years.
3. For every 20% growth I take home 20% of the profit, no matter what. For crazy rockets I might take home more, say half the profit of every 20% growth.

&#x200B;

So what do I do with my profits? Well, I do a few things.

&#x200B;

1. I reinvest them in to other stocks, so I make sure I have a short list of alternatives at all times
2. I put them in the cash position so I can be opportunistic (but still max 15%)
3. I buy my wife or kids presents, I pay off mortgate, I get a nice Rolex or refurbish the house.  Its money. I have money so I can spend it, use it.

&#x200B;

Moral of the story. Make money, you probably won't see another opportunity like the one of the past 6 months. Its not coming back for a while. Don't step out of the market, pick your stocks wisely, keep some cash to pounce on some disappointing Q4's and remember its not money until you sell.

1977,Understanding common misconceptions surrounding stock splits,389,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i12p6p/understanding_common_misconceptions_surrounding/,62,"Welcome to my latest Ted talk!

Every other post seems to be about the announcement from Apple ($AAPL) in regards to their 4-1 stock split. There seems to be a lot of misconceptions around stock splits. In an attempt to help out the community I’m going to answer some of the common questions I’ve been seeing lately.

First off, *what happens when a company splits their stock?*

In the case of $AAPL, the stock is splitting 4-1. On August 31st the shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis. If the shares pre-split were trading for $400 a share, post-split they will be trading for $100 a share. The number of shares in circulation as a result will increase by 4x. **This means the companies valuation will not change.**

*What about my options contract?*

The vast majority of time with a conventional split like what we will see with $AAPL, options contracts will be adjusted similar to conventional stock ownership. If you own 1 400c contract, post-split you’ll own 4 100c options. While I don’t expect this outcome, it is also possible for a non-standard options contract instead. Non-standard contracts are common with reverse splits, not very common with this sort of split. 

*What about dividends?*

The dividend yield is expressed as a percentage. 1% (rounding up) will be same regardless if you own 1 share at $400 or 4 shares at $100. 

*Should you buy before the stock split or after?*

While a stock may see increased volatility post-split, investing in a company should be done when you as the investor feel the stock is undervalued. This may be pre-split or post-split based on price action. If you are actively trading you may be able to take a speculative position pre-split with the assumption that post-split there will be increased interest in the stock and thus an increase in share price. There is no guarantee we’ll experience a post-split rally though.

**Bottom Line**

Fundamentally nothing changes with a stock pick. When companies execute stock splits they’re simply reducing the cost and thus the barrier to entry for small time investors.

*****
> In the coming week, there are some major retailers reporting earnings, including Walmart, Home Depot and Target, but the season is mostly over and the market is entering a quiet period. There are minutes from the Fed’s last meeting, released Wednesday, and housing data, including starts Tuesday and existing sales Friday.
*****
> Investors had been watching efforts by Congress to agree to a new stimulus package, but talks have failed and the Senate has gone on recess. There is a concern that Congress will not be convinced to provide a big enough package when it does get to work again on the next stimulus round because recent economic reports look stronger. July’s retail sales, for example, climbed to a record level and recovered to pre-pandemic levels.
*****
> “The juxtaposition of getting more fiscal stimulus and better data has paralyzed us in our tracks … we’ve seen this sideways [market] action,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Alliance. “It feels like we need more action from Congress, and the concern is the longer we wait, the better the data gets and the less impactful the next round of stimulus will be.”
*****
> Some technical analysts say the market may pull back around the high, to allow it to consolidate gains before moving higher into the end of the year. The S&P 500 reached an all-time high of 3,393 on Feb. 19.
*****
> Hogan said he expects stocks to tread sideways during the dog days of August, but they could begin to react negatively to the election in September. He also said it is important that progress continue against the spread of Covid-19, as the economy continues to reopen.
*****
> Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the market could have a wakeup call at some point that the stimulus package has not been approved.
*****
> “I think it will cross over a line where they care,” he said. “I think the market is in suspended animation of believing there will be a magical deal.” Boockvar said he expects a deal ultimately, but the impact is not likely to be as big as the last round of funding.
*****
> “What they’re not grasping is any deal, any extension of unemployment benefits, is going to be smaller than it was, and the rate of change should be the most important thing investors focus on,” he said. “Not the binary outcome of whether there’s a deal or no deal. There’s going to be less air going into the balloon.”
*****

> Still, economists expect to see a strong rebound in the third quarter, and are anticipating about about a 20% jump in third-quarter growth. But they also say that could be threatened if Congress does not help with another stimulus package.
*****
> Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, described the July retail sales as a perfect V-shaped recovery, but cautioned it would not last unless more aid gets to individuals and cities and states. Democrats have sought a $3 trillion spending package, and Republicans in the Senate offered a $1 trillion package. They could not reach a compromise, including on a $600 weekly payment to individuals on unemployment which expired July 31.
*****
> President Donald Trump has tried to fill the gap with executive orders to provide extra benefits to those on unemployment, but the $300 federal payment and $100 from states may take some time to reach individuals, as the processing varies by state. He has also issued an order instructing the Treasury to temporarily defer collection of payroll taxes from individuals making up to $104,000.

> “I think in August and September, there will be a lot of Ws, if there’s not more help here,” said Zandi, referring to an economic recovery that retrenches from a V shape before heading higher again. “It’s clearly perplexing. It may take the stock market to say we’re not going to get what we expect, and sell off and light a fire.”
*****
> Zandi said it could come to a situation like 2008, where the stock market sold off sharply before Congress would agree to a program that helped financial companies.
*****
> “We need a TARP moment to get these guys to help. Maybe if the claims tick higher and the August employment numbers are soft, given the president is focused on the stock market, that might be what it takes to get them back to the table in earnest,” he said, referring to the Troubled Asset Relief Program that helped rescue banks during the financial crisis.
*****
> He ultimately expects a package of about $1.5 trillion to be approved in September.
*****
> The lack of funding for state and local governments could result in more layoffs, as they struggle with their current 2021 budgets, Zandi said. Already 1.3 million public sector jobs have been lost since February, and there will be more layoffs and more programs and projects cancelled. The impact will hit contractors and other businesses that provide services to local governments.
*****
> “The multipliers on state and local government are among the highest of any form of support, so if you don’t provide it, it’s going to ripple through the economy pretty fast,” he said.
*****
> Economists expect to see a softening in consumer spending in August with the more than 28 million Americans on unemployment benefits as of mid-July no longer receiving any supplemental pay.
*****
> “The real irony is things are shaping up that September is going to be a bad month, and that’s going to show up in all the data in October,” Zandi said. “They are really taking a chance on this election by not acting.”

> # 4 Charts That Will Amaze You

> The S&P 500 Index is a few points away from a new all-time high, completing one of the fastest recoveries from a bear market ever. But this will also seal the deal on the shortest bear market ever. Remember, the S&P 500 Index lost 20% from an all-time high in only 16 trading days back in February and March, so it makes sense that this recovery could be one of the fastest ever.

> From the lows on March 23, the S&P 500 has now added more than 50%. Many have been calling this a bear market rally for months, while we have been in the camp this is something more. It’s easy to see why this rally is different based on where it stands versus other bear market rallies:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.12.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> They say the stock market is the only place where things go on sale, yet everyone runs out of the store screaming. We absolutely saw that back in March and now with stocks near new highs, many have missed this record run. Here we show how stocks have been usually higher a year or two after corrections.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.12.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> After a historic drop in March, the S&P 500 has closed higher in April, May, June, and July. This rare event has happened only 11 other times, with stocks gaining the final five months of the year a very impressive 10 times. Only 2018 and the nearly 20% collapse in December saw a loss those final five months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GS-Blog-Chart.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this bear market will go down as the fastest ever, at just over one month. The recovery back to new highs will be five months if we get there by August 23, making this one of the fastest recoveries ever. Not surprisingly, it usually takes longer for bear markets in a recession to recover; only adding to the impressiveness of this rally.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.12.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> “It normally takes 30 months for bear markets during a recession to recover their losses, which makes this recovery all the more amazing,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strateigst Ryan Detrick.. “Then again, there has been nothing normal about this recession, so maybe we shouldn’t be shocked about yet another record going down in 2020.”

> # When a Few Basis Points Packs a Punch

> US Treasury yields have been on the rise this week with the 10-year yield rising 13 basis points (bps) from 0.56% up to 0.69% after getting as high as 0.72% on Thursday. A 13 bps move higher in interest rates may not seem like a whole lot, but with rates already at such low levels, a small move can have a pretty big impact on the prices of longer-term maturities.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/081420-10-Year-Yield.png))**

> Starting with longer-term US Treasuries, TLT, which measures the performance of maturities greater than 20 years, has declined 3.5% this week. Now, for a growth stock, 3.5% is par for the course, but that kind of move in the Treasury market is no small thing. The latest pullback for TLT also coincides with another failed attempt by the ETF to trade and stay above $170 for more than a day.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/081420-TLT.png))**

> The further out the maturity window you go in the fixed income market, the bigger the impact of the move higher in interest rates. The Republic of Austria issued a 100-year bond in 2017, and its movements exemplify the wild moves that small changes in interest rates (from a low base) can have on prices. Just this week, the Austrian 100-year was down over 5%, which is a painful move no matter what type of asset class you are talking about. This week's move, though, was nothing compared to the stomach-churning swings from earlier this year. When Covid was first hitting the fan, the 100-year rallied 57% in the span of less than two months. That kind of move usually occurs over years rather than days, but in less than a third of that time, all those gains disintegrated in a two-and-a-half week span from early to late March. Easy come, easy go. Ironically enough, despite all the big up and down moves in this bond over the last year, as we type this, the bond's price is the same now as it was on this same day last year.

> # Retail Sales Rock to New Highs

> At the headline level, July’s Retail Sales report disappointed as the reading missed expectations by nearly a full percentage point. Just as soon as the report was released, we saw a number of stories pounce on the disappointment as a sign that the economy was losing steam. Looked at in more detail, though, the July report wasn’t all that bad. While the headline reading rose less than expected (1.2% vs 2.1%), Ex Autos and Ex Autos and Gas, the results were much better than expected. Not only that, but June’s original readings were all revised higher by around a full percentage point.

> Besides the fact that this month’s report was better underneath the surface and June’s reading was revised higher, it was also notable as the seasonally-adjusted annualized rate of sales in July hit a new record high. After the last record high back in January, only five months passed until American consumers were back to their pre-Covid spending ways. For the sake of comparison, back during the Financial Crisis, 40 months passed between the original high in Retail Sales in November 2007 and the next record high in April 2011. 5 months versus 40? Never underestimate the power of the US consumer!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/081420-retail-sales-chart1.png))**

> While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just released B.I.G. Tips report we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.

> # 100 Days of Gains

> Today marked 100 trading days since the Nasdaq 100's March 20th COVID Crash closing low. Below is a chart showing the rolling 100-trading day percentage change of the Nasdaq 100 since 1985. The 59.8% gain over the last 100 trading days ranks as the 3rd strongest run on record. The only two stronger 100-day rallies ended in January 1999 and March 2000.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/ndx100use.png))**

> While the Nasdaq 100 bottomed on Friday, March 20th, the S&P 500 bottomed the following Monday (3/23). This means tomorrow will mark 100 trading days since the S&P 500's COVID Crash closing low. Right now the rolling 100-day percentage change for the S&P 500 sits at +46.7%. But if the S&P manages to trade at current levels tomorrow, the 100-day gain will jump above 50%. It has been 87 years (1933) since we've seen a 100-day gain of more than 50%!

> # B.I.G. Tips - New Highs In Sight

> Whether you want to look at it from the perspective of closing prices or intraday levels, the S&P 500 is doing what just about everybody thought would be impossible less than five months ago - approaching record highs. Relative to its closing high of 3,386.15, the S&P 500 is just 0.27% lower, while it's within half of a percent from its record intraday high of 3,393.52. Through today, the S&P 500 has gone 120 trading days without a record high, and as shown in the chart below, the current streak is barely even visible when viewed in the perspective of all streaks since 1928. Even if we zoom in on just the last five years, the current streak of 120 trading days only ranks as the fourth-longest streak without a new high.

> While the S&P 500's 120-trading day streak without a new high isn't extreme by historical standards, the turnaround off the lows has been extraordinary. In the S&P 500's history, there have been ten prior declines of at least 20% from a record closing high. Of those ten prior periods, the shortest gap between the original record high and the next one was 309 trading days, and the shortest gap between highs that had a pullback of at least 30% was 484 tradings days (or more than four times the current gap of 120 trading days). For all ten streaks without a record high, the median drought was 680 trading days.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/Streaks-Chart.png))**

> Whenever the S&P 500 does take out its 2/19 high, the question is whether the new high represents a breakout where the S&P 500 keeps rallying into evergreen territory, or does it run out of gas after finally reaching a new milestone? To shed some light on this question, we looked at the S&P 500's performance following each prior streak of similar duration without a new high.

(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk’s war with Tesla Inc. short sellers just got weirder.

The electric carmaker claims a California man who it says is part of an online group of short sellers has been stalking its Fremont factory and harassing its employees -- including dangerously swerving his car toward a Tesla Model 3 that was on a freeway test drive and injuring a Tesla security guard in a hit-and-run on company property.

This is unnerving and the company representative admitted to this YouTuber that he was already working with (and paying) dozens of popular investing channels.

A DraftKings representative told Sports Handle via email this week that the company doesn’t “have any comment to provide regarding the MSP application/license in the state.”

FanDuel is pursuing a similar strategy via a partnership or purchase of Fairmount Racetrack. For DraftKings, it’s currently unclear who the partner would be, but Harrah’s Joliet, Jumer’s Rock Island, and the Casino Queen have not publicly disclosed who their online partners will be and could be possibilities.”

Enter:  Twitter.

Who are these dudes?  Who knows, their account names are pop culture alerts.   But their last tweet said they had HUGE gainzzzz.


You immediately put those stocks on your radar, and watch it jump.  It may immediately fly 10-15%!  So FOMO kicks in, and you make the jump.  After all, it’s going to move quick so get on it!   Just wait for that sweet ATH after close!   


“Great,” you think.  “I’ll wake up to that Lambo.”



The next morning, the alerts start at market bell.  $smallbioX down 40%.  70%.  You just got smacked.   But you’re not alone, right?  Those Twitter guys share your misery, right?

We all have an instilled dogma that we will _always recover_. Japan's stock market never recovered from the 1990's, neither has China's, and many European countries' stock markets have still not recovered from the 2008 financial crisis. 

Is it really so farfetched that we won't ever see 3400 again?  Do we really have that much room for growth to take us past 3400?  This bull market has been driven mainly by stock buybacks and lax taxation laws from our current president.

A recession is defined as two or more consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. Check out this site and play around with the chart to get a feel of how GDP growth has been changing: https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth

(I suggest you change the chart parameters to 10 years and select ""columns"" instead of ""line"")

A market decline could be a predictor of a future recession so I'm not arguing against that. Let's just be careful about our rhetoric around the term ""recession"" and not confuse economic terminology please. There are a lot of people new to stocks and investing here, we don't want to send the wrong message. 

That is all, thanks, good luck to everyone!

&#x200B;

I just needed a place to vent, because I just made the most stupid decision in my life, and I can't really justify it to myself or anyone that I know.

&#x200B;

Back in February, I decided that QCOMs case vs AAPL was putting a lot of pressure on the QCOMs stock price and realized that the options are very cheap considering the opportunity for a favorable outcome.

&#x200B;

I bought 75 April 18 call options with a strike price of 65 for $0.10 each, and till yesterday night I was still holding them.

&#x200B;

I live in Australia, so I am mostly sleeping during US trading hours. Yesterday, however, I woke up at 4 am and decided to put a limit sell order of $0.06 on my options to salvage my losses given that only 2 days are remaining till expiry, and went back to sleep.

&#x200B;

I wake up at 7 am to go to work, and see the news and realize that my options would have been worth a small fortune and the contract is being traded at $6 each which would have realized a 6000% return for me in 2 months.

&#x200B;

Long story short, I lost the opportunity to make $50,000 just because I made a very stupid decision when I woke up at 4 AM! I feel so disgusted with myself and I dont know what to do to feel better. I got everything right but screwed up at the last minute. I feel so angry with myself and having a mental breakdown, and I needed to let someone know what happened.

&#x200B;

How do I live myself and go on with my life after that?

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for all of those who offered support and understanding of the situation. I truly understand my mistake, and I know I failed because I never really had a risk and an action plan. It was never about trading for me.

&#x200B;

I started following QCOM back in 2016 and I knew almost everything about the lawsuits and the risks facing the company. In January and February, when the stock fell to the 50s, I started building my thesis and realized the following:

&#x200B;

Telecom Companies started tolling 5G networks.

Phone manufacturers are introducing 5G phones in 2019.

Huwaei and Qualcomm are the global leaders in 5G modems.

Intel is far behind in 5G technology and the sole supplier for AAPL modems.

AAPL cannot really introduce a 5G phone in 2019 if they don't settle with Qualcomm early in the year.

&#x200B;

Given the above, I was almost certain that the settlement will happen, and when I looked into options I knew the risk/return were exceptional so I decided to take a small position. Unfortunately for me, I got the timing just wrong because I haven't planned on rerolling my options and I took action at a time when I wasn't really aware of the complete consequences of selling my position. When I think about it now, I know how stupid that was, just because the option was trading at 0.03 when I put my limit order, and the only reason my order will be executed at 0.06 will be favorable news. If I analyzed that more at the time, I would have realized that putting the order is the worst possible decision. 

&#x200B;

A hard lesson for sure..",2019-04-17 09:59:52

The sheet lists all the companies from the five main ARK ETF's (ARK K,W,G,F,Q), with multiple data such as live stock prices, live stock return, weight in the portfolios, etc.

Due to regular changes in both amount of shares owned in the ETF's and changes to companies owned, we plan to update the sheet fairly often.

We will happily take any constructive feedback, if it adds to the usability of the sheet. :)

I definitely feel like it’s something this sub (especially Nio mooners🚀) could benefit from seeing and discussing. I swear, it’s a 2 minute read: 

————————————
Two years after Citron Research editor and notorious short seller Andrew Left made a bold bullish call on Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE: NIO), Left said Friday it’s finally time for investors to cash out of the red-hot EV stock.

Back in November 2018, Left compared Nio to Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) when Nio was trading at around $7 per share. Today, Nio shares are trading at $53. *($46.70 at the time of this Reddit post)*

“After a rocky road of trading, NIO has found itself in unchartered territory that can never be justified by its current standing in the China EV market or its near-term prospects,” Left wrote Friday.

2 Vulnerabilities: Left said Nio has two major vulnerabilities in the near-term.

Tesla’s Model Y price cuts will apply significant pressure to sales of Nio’s ES6 hatchback model. Last month, Tesla sold nearly twice the number of vehicles in China that Nio sold, and Left is expecting China’s EV market to continue to be an intensely competitive pricing environment.

Left is not a fan of Nio’s share structure.

“While we commend Baillie Gifford (love those people) and early investors, right now we are looking at a share structure and an investor base that is more interested in spinning a casino wheel,” said Left. He also noted Nio's short interest is approaching a two-year low.

What Nio Investors Are Buying: Left said investors buying Nio today should understand what they are getting into.

“Anyone buying NIO stock now is not buying a company or its prospects, rather you are buying 3 letters that move on a screen,” he wrote.

Left said there are better ways to play the China EV story: “It is time for investors to rotate out of NIO, enjoy your profits and look for the next disruptive technology.”

Left's new price target for Nio is $25, suggesting more than 50% downside.

Benzinga’s Take: There’s no question the Chinese EV market will be a major growth story for years to come. But Nio’s market cap has now surpassed Daimler’s despite the fact that Nio sells roughly 5,000 vehicles per month and Daimler sells about 1 million vehicles per month.

*Thoughts?*



Edit: For those asking “WTF is Citron?” Below is what I skimmed from his Wikipedia, but there is a whole ass section about his reports on Chinese companies and what Chinese companies and leaders have taken legal action against him. He’s already banned from trading in Hong Kong for 5 years because of his report on a HK real estate company being insolvent. 
————————————

Left initially started StockLemon.com in 2001 as a self-published blog containing reports on controversial companies. He rebranded the site as Citron Research in 2007.Left researches and short sells companies he believes to be engaged in fraud, have been suspiciously promoted, or have been mistakenly overpriced by the stock market.

According to a Wall Street Journal analysis of 111 Citron short-sale reports spanning from 2001 to 2014, there was an average share-price decline of 42 percent in the year after Left's report was released. Of those shares, 90 were lower one year later while 21 gained, according to data from S&amp;P Capital IQ.

Citron Research has published reports on 18 Chinese companies, 16 of which experienced a drop in stock prices, with 15 of them experiencing drops of over 70%.[38] This has caused a collective of Chinese business leaders, including Qihoo 360 CEO Zhou Hongyi (a company that has been targeted by Left), to launch a site called CitronFraud.com (no longer operating).[39] Left sent a legal notice to the 60 Chinese executives involved, seeking an apology, and told Tech In Asia that he is consulting with lawyers and considering legal action in response.[40]",2020-11-14 03:55:55

2034,Positivity for newbies without a lot of $ to invest,362,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k5sjse/positivity_for_newbies_without_a_lot_of_to_invest/,126,"Hey! I'm pretty new to this, but if you are too and you're anything like me, you've probably seen a lot of people talking about how they've bought 300 shares of this, dropped $2k on that, have six figures in ETFs, etc. I've even seen a couple comments scoffing at people who only have a couple hundred to invest. I dunno about you, but it can get frustrating and disheartening. So I just wanted to take a minute and say: you're doing great just by getting started!

It really doesn't matter how much money you have. Sure, the more you can invest, the more you can (potentially) gain, but any profit is profit. If you want to get into trading like a lot of people do here, it's perfectly okay to start with $100, buy a share or two in something that seems reliable yet cheap, make like $5, sell it, rinse and repeat. You can work your way up to doubling or tripling your initial investment by just buying a good stock on a red day, waiting a few days, and selling when it's in the green by a few dollars. It's not as glamorous or fast as people talking about their $10k gains in a day but it is profit, it can be faster than long-term investing when you're just getting started, and it does allow you more money to play with without having to put in more of your own.

And if you want to start investing long-term, any amount is a great amount. $100 in a savings account might make 0.20% APY, like what my bank offers. $100 in ETFs could get you ~10% annual returns. $10 in a year doesn't sound like much, but it's a massive improvement over 20¢. (And you'll almost definitely put aside more than $100 year to year anyway, but you get the point.)

All in all, any profit is profit, the best amount to trade with is anything you can afford to lose, the best time to start long-term investing is always immediately, and it's perfectly fine if all you're making is a few dollars trading or investing. The important part is that you're getting started, so don't get discouraged! Best of luck to all of us =)


p.s. Also, IMO, short-term trading is okay! As long as you know the risks (yes, even of meme stocks) you can treat this as a game or a casino or whatever you want. Like someone else here said, this is /r/stocks, not /r/investing. At the end of the day it's your money, and sometimes stupid-seeming risks will make way more profit overnight than safe long-term investments will in years, and sometimes you'll lose your life's savings in a day and wish you'd just gone the investing route with $VOO or something. Do whatever you're comfortable with, don't listen to anyone scoffing about what investing has become. (Although, I guess, take what I've said with a grain of salt too! I am probably just as new as you ;b Feel free to correct me on anything as well!)",2020-12-03 18:10:23

Intel is reverting to the illegal behaviors that they were found guilty of in many jurisdictions worldwide during the 2003 to 2007 period.

The following is a Google translation of a Dutch report about VU University Amsterdam's announcement of this latest (among many) of Intel security leaks that have compromised the security and performance of their customers. The performance impact alone can, according to Intel, be as high as 9%, and this leaps up to nearly 50% if you also (as many recommend) turn off hyperthreading. The article is long, but well worth a read. I've bolded the following two excerpts from the full text:

**According to the VU, Intel tried to downplay the severity of the leak by officially paying $40,000 in reward and ""$80,000"" in addition. That offer was politely refused.**

**""If it were up to Intel, they would have wanted to wait another six months""**

Translation from Dutch to English:

# VU discovers megaleak in Intel chips

Thanks to a mistake, the VU uncovered a mega breach in Intel chips. Intel pays the price for a fast but risky design.

The news in brief:

* **Researchers from the VU University Amsterdam have found an extensive data breach that is present in all Intel processors. These chips are in more than 80 percent of all computers and servers.**
* **On Tuesday evening, Intel and VU announced the details of RIDL (Rogue In-Flight Data Load), a vulnerability that allows malicious parties to ""steal almost all data"" from computers. Unauthorized persons can view the data that the processor is currently processing.**
* **The vulnerability is in all Intel processors of the last ten years - including the very latest. Hackers can exploit the vulnerability by hiding code in a web advertisement.**

Two rack cabinets from the Ikea full of computer walls, a jumble of cables and a stack of second-hand processors. It is not immediately the test lab that you expect from which VU University researchers uncovered the sophisticated, super-complex leak in recent months.

Here, in room P455, on the fourth floor of the W&N building in Amsterdam, it was demonstrated that all Intel processors of the past ten years are susceptible to a major leak. This means that more than 80 percent of all computers in the world are susceptible to an attack that gives access to data at the heart of the computer.

RIDL, as the new vulnerability was baptized, came to light by chance. On Tuesday 11 September, Stephan van Schaijk, Computer Science student at VU University Amsterdam, worked on his study assignment: investigating a leak in the Intel processor.

Van Schaijk: „I was busy for an hour but did not advance. I adjusted something in my code and then I saw something strange appear on the screen. Values ​​I did not expect. ""

Van Schaijk had made a mistake, a bug in a bug, with which he could suddenly watch what happened in another program. It was a bigger and more serious leak than he was actually looking for.

His colleagues and teachers were just as surprised. Together, they wrote more than 20 ""exploits"" attack scenarios in a short time that would allow hackers to take control of the computer.

One of those tricks: by logging in with an incorrect password, the attacker forces the computer to compare the wrong password with the correct password. This data runs through the 'pipelines' of the chip and can be intercepted, after which the hacker can retrieve the correct password after some tinkering. ""You find fragments. As if you are going to get a paper document through the shredder and then reassemble the shreds, ”says Herbert Bos, professor of system and network security at the VU.

Stephan van Schaijk was sent out to buy as many different processors as possible, to see if they were all vulnerable.

And that was true. Even the oldest one, from 2008, that was picked up via Marktplaats, turned out to be vulnerable to RIDL, or Rogue In-Flight Data Load. And so, Intel was immediately warned.

A beer please

It is not the first time that Intel gets into trouble with a leak in its processors. The chip is extra fast because it is ahead of things: each time the processor speculates which data is probably needed next. This presents risks because computer processes do not remain well separated from each other.

Assistant professor Kaveh Razavi compares it to a café: the processor works like a waitress who assumes that you want to drink the same as the one before you. The glass is poured automatically without the waitress checking whether you can have that beer.

The solution: the tray must be emptied after every order. That makes the processor slower. Depending on the programs you use, the speed difference can be considerable, the researchers expect. That explains why Intel has been struggling so long to fix this leak.

RIDL cuts right through all existing security layers. This applies to the data centers where virtual systems often run on the same server. The encrypted environment that Intel devised for business customers is also vulnerable.

Premium with aftertaste

Although parts of the leak were found by several researchers from different universities and companies, the VU has discovered the majority. Amsterdam University is also the only party to receive a reward: $100,000 (89,000 euros), Intel's maximum reward for discoverers of critical leaks.

There is a small taste to the premium. **According to the VU, Intel tried to downplay the severity of the leak by officially paying $40,000 in reward and ""$80,000"" in addition. That offer was politely refused.**

Anyone who accepts a reward must also adhere to the rules. In this case, that meant: no consultation between researchers and uncertainty about which software manufacturers were warned in advance. According to the researchers, tech companies do not reason in the interests of the user, but of the shareholder.

Intel initially failed to notify Google and Mozilla, two major browser manufacturers.

The VU tried to force the manufacturer to come out faster. Eventually the VU forced Intel to come out in May - otherwise the university would publish the details itself. ""**If it were up to Intel, they would have wanted to wait another six months**,"" says Bos.

Intel had promised that the next generation of chips would not be vulnerable to RIDL, but that is not the case.

Hackers usually anticipate software vulnerabilities. Undiscovered holes (zero days) in important programs are sold for a lot of money in the black circuit. But after Specter and Meltdown, two fundamental holes that were previously found in Intel chips, both the ethical computer experts and the criminal figures are pointing their hardware. ""Processors have become so complex that chip makers no longer have security under control,"" said Bos.

And what should you do as a computer user? Update, update and update again. It is expected that all major software manufacturers will close the gap or have already closed the latest releases. It's not for nothing that RIDL comes out on Patch Tuesday, the monthly update day from Microsoft.",2019-05-16 01:18:18

Stocks traded choppily today, with the market rising throughout the session before nose-diving in the last hour. The benchmarks are now firmly in correction territory, roughly 10% below their record highs at the beginning of the month, erasing the gains from a historic August. Traders are digesting a range of concerns, including uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election, signs of slowdowns in economic growth, dimming hopes for more fiscal stimulus, and worsening trends in Covid-19 cases, particularly in Europe.

After rising in the morning, the major indices cut their gains in the final hour of trading. The S&P finished 0.24% up, the Dow finished 0.17% up, and the Nasdaq finished 0.47% up.

Today, the Labor Department released their weekly jobless claim report, which showed that another 870,000 individuals filed new unemployment claims. This is slightly above Wall Street’s estimates but below the 1,000,000 level that’s become a key marker to measure the health of the pandemic-stricken job market. This data shows that jobs are not coming back at the rate that Wall Street would like and that workers are continuing to struggle to secure jobs in our healing economy. 

Chris Rupkey, chief economist for MUFG Union Bank said, “The labor market losses are stunning in that they show there isn't enough work out there yet in the middle of September nine months after the Covid-19 virus shut the economy down. The stock market is falling again over the concerns for the economy as well they should because the high-level of joblessness shows that the country isn't out of the woods yet and it won't be if the pleading of Fed officials for more stimulus isn't heard by Federal government officials down in Washington.” 

Unfortunately, hopes for more stimulus are looking increasingly unlikely before the November election Congressional lawmakers are at an impasse over how much fiscal stimulus should be passed and to whom it should be directed. And more recently with the tragic passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Congress’ focus is now on the Supreme Court.

**Expedia** ($EXPE) announced a C-Suite transition that was altogether less smooth with the resignation of both the CEO and CFO after a disagreement on strategy and disappointing Q3 results. The company's now ex-CEO Okerstrom had begun a push for Expedia to integrate its brands and technology earlier in the year.  It appears he has been ditched due to a subsequent lack of focus on Expedia's core business that resulted from this push.

However pressure from Google suggests Okerstrom' strategy may have been the right one. Competitors Airbnb, TripAdvisor and Booking have all been implementing a similar strategy of integrating their brands and technology.  Expedia’s very real problems remain, namely it needs to wean itself off of Google SEO as a source of traffic or face getting further squeezed as Google continues to convert more traffic from free to paid.

There were also a couple of interesting articles in Barron's saying **Amazon** ($AMZN) ""cannot be beaten"" and that **Nike** ($NKE) ""is in the early innings of transition from a traditional wholesale business""

In summary, Citi analyst Jason Bazinet said other traditional retailers and e-commerce firms are unable to replicate Amazon's scale and capabilities. That means that Amazon can continue to grow by selling goods at a loss while offsetting losses with the profitable selling of services to enterprises. If he is right then Amazon looks cheap with annual forecast growth of 72% compared to a TTM PE 78. 

However it seems there is one very specific exception to Mr Bazinet’s assertion with Nike’s decision to no longer sell merchandise through Amazon showing that strong brands are realizing that traffic driven to their own site is self-sustaining, more profitable, and actually brand enhancing. Morgan Stanley’s Kimberly Greenberger’s has a TP 22% above current level and says, “We continue to believe NKE is in the early innings of transition from a traditional wholesale business to a digitally-driven, direct-to-consumer brand,”

CEO Virginia Drosos says the company’s “transformation journey” is starting to pay off with recent initiatives beginning to take hold. “Starting with customer first, much better product marketing, and a transformed media plan for this holiday season, better omni channel, iPads in the hands of every jewelry consultant, and better websites,” Drosos said “And we're driving out costs in the business that we've been able to reinvest to drive growth.”

The company guided to full year non-GAAP diluted EPS of between $3.11 - $3.29 which looks attractive compared to the stock price of $20.58.

Encouragingly Drosos said “In the jewelry category, the consumer market is healthy,” and continued, “We've seen over the last number of years low single digit growth in the category, and we expect that to continue.""

&#x200B;

**At Home Group** **Inc** ($HOME) beat top and bottom line third-quarter estimates but disappointed analysts with a guidance cut. After a difficult Thanksgiving, At Home sees fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 31-36 cents per share, significantly below the 49 cent per share consensus estimate. That reflects 25% off discounting on seasonal items at an earlier time than At Home has ever implemented.

However the stock looks cheap following its 33% drop with a valuation of less than 10x current year estimates.

KeyBanc Capital Markets Bradley Thomas maintained an Overweight rating but cut its price target from $14 to $10 (Friday’s closing price was $5.67) and said “Ultimately, recent trends are undeniably frustrating, but we believe the Company is taking its medicine on markdowns and has mostly de-risked 4Q,” Thomas wrote, “New store performance remains strong and HOME continues to take share from competitors.”

Wells Fargo maintained a Market Weight rating and $7 target with Zachary Fadem saying encouragingly, “Looking ahead to next year, we believe the roll outs of EDLP+ \[Everyday Low Prices\] and BOPIS \[Buy Online Pickup Instore\] can drive incremental sales and improve HOME’s value perception with consumers”.

&#x200B;

**Growth stocks (Duluth Holdings Inc, The Trade Desk and Ulta Beauty)** 

**Duluth Holdings Inc** ($DLTH) is up 20% after reporting strong Q3 results on Thursday that beat expectations with healthy top-line growth of 12% and improved third-quarter operating margin and earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. Revenue of $119.90 million thrashed analysts’ estimates of $114.97 million and full year EPS guidance of 60 cents to 66 cents compared to consensus forecasts for 60 cents.

That’s good news for the rapidly growing lifestyle brand with well-established direct business. The company opened 3 new stores during the quarter, taking the total to 58, but has identified markets with 100 potential store locations meaning there is still plenty of potential for growth.

&#x200B;

At $247.35 (market cap of $11.2bn) **The Trade Desk's** ($TTD) stock price has recovered some of Monday’s correction but is still significantly down from recent highs of $290. On Friday, Needham analyst Laura Martin upgraded the stock from Hold to Buy with a new $325 price target.

That’s in line with the CEO who maintains the view that most of the $700 billion plus pie of advertising will end up programmatic - that's a huge opportunity for the $11 billion market leader.

Global markets in particular have huge potential but account for just 14% of The Trade Desk’s current business. That figure should grow to two-thirds, reflecting the global break down. The Trade Desk is the only mainstream DSP with a strong play in China and that could drive huge returns.

&#x200B;

**Ulta Beauty’s** ($ULTA) stock jumped 11% on Friday after reporting a strong Q3. Comps rose 3.2%, driving overall revenue growth of 7.9% and gross margin improved 40 basis points to 37.1%. Full-year guidance was raised to EPS of $11.93 to $12.03, up from a previous range of $11.86 to $12.06 and up from $10.94 last year.

That will suit CEO Mary Dillon who bought $308,000 of stock in September. The prestige cosmetics industry has seen growth slow from its frenetic pace of recent years but (on a PE of 22x current year estimates) Ulta doesn’t look expensive.

&#x200B;

**Speculative and high risk (electroCore)**

This week, the UK’s Depart of Health agency NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) published its guidance recommending the use of **electroCore’s** ($ECORE) gammaCore treatment for the acute and preventive treatment of cluster headache in adults.

Even though treatment costs about £3,000 ($4,000) per year, the NICE guidance states that gammaCore, when added to standard of care, can save an average of £450 ($590) per patient in the first year of treatment.  Additionally, among the comments received by NICE in their review of gammaCore are endorsements from UK neurologists expressing strong support for patient access to gammaCore in the NHS, such as “This device has changed the way we practice - it has huge implications beyond the results of headache diaries,” and “\[I have\] had a lot of experience with seeing clinical responses and the meaningful and significant impact this treatment can commonly have on people's lives.”

That’s pretty encouraging.

Iain Strickland, Managing Director of electroCore UK, said “approximately 66,000 people in the UK suffer from this devastating headache disorder, and experts have reported that 25-50% of the most severely affected will benefit from our therapy,”

Back of the envelope that suggests (66,000 x 37.5% x 4,000) $92.4 million of revenues from the UK alone which would go along way to offsetting electroCore’s $50 million annual cash burn and set up the company for profitability.

Additionally, in the US back in April 2017, the FDA cleared electroCore’s gammaCore therapy for the acute treatment of cluster headache, or CH. CH is an extremely painful form of headache affecting approximately 350,000 people in the United States with an estimated total addressable U.S. market of approximately $400 million. Additionally, according to a 2016 market research survey, 87% of respondents reported dissatisfaction with the then-available treatment options for managing CH. 

Further, in January 2018, the FDA cleared electroCore gammaCore therapy for electroCore’s lead indication: the acute treatment of migraine in adults. Reports suggest an even greater total addressable market of approximately $4 billion and some reports suggest that up to 60% of migraine sufferers are dissatisfied with, or have contraindications to, the current standard of care treatments. 

Unfortunately the UK news probably comes too late to save existing shareholders from significant dilution. With an annual cash burn of c.$50 million and cash of just $33.5 million as of September 30th.  We could easily be looking at 30 million new shares at $1, diluting exiting shareholders 1:1 (or worse).

It is probably wise to wait to see the terms of that issuance before entering into a position. However, the guidance and comments from the UK are extremely positive. If electroCore can execute in the UK and bring some of that success back to the US then, even with dilution, it could yet be a multibagger.

**Insider buying (Evolent Health and Kodak)** 

Insider buying at **Evolent Health** ($EVH) Inc this week with the CEO purchasing $228,000 of stock on Tuesday followed by a $100,000 purchase by the President on Thursday. It comes after a 75% drop in the stock in just over a year. Last week the stock dropped almost 40% after reporting that it’s largest customer, Passport Health, had lost the contract to manage the $8B per year Kentucky Medicaid business which it had maintained for 20 years.

It’s a terrible blow that could put Passport out of business and bad news for Evolent who derive 12% of their revenues from Passport and had recently agreed to purchase a 70% ownership for $70 million (expected to close by the end of this year). However I think the 40% drop looks overdone and insider buying sends a signal that management think so too.

CEO Frank Williams noted that there was a possibility that Passport would not be awarded the Kentucky contract in the Q3 conference call last month and said, “If Passport's contract is not renewed beyond June, 2020 than we anticipate services growth in 2020 of at least 10%.” That is a lot lower than the 20% expected if it had won the contract but still suggests a very healthy level of growth. Additionally Passport Health Plan has confirmed that they intend to appeal Kentucky's decision meaning they could well win some of the business.

However, even when assuming the worst case scenario of 10% growth, the valuation of Evolent (trading at just 0.77x sales) looks cheap. 

&#x200B;

Insider buying at **Kodak** ($KODK) after two directors made purchases of $5.5 million and $11.1 million this week. They follow Executive Chairman James Continenza who increased his holding last week by 50% with a $103,000 purchase. 

The once iconic film manufacturer has struggled since it emerged from bankruptcy proceedings in 2015. It does have a number of growth engines that account for about 25% of revenues, including its SONORA Process Free Plates which grew by 22% in Q3 and the PROSPER Inkjet Platform which grew by 5 percent, but these as yet have not been enough to offset the decline and overall revenues fell by 4.3%.

The company is not expensive with a market cap of $111 million compared to net cash of $75 million. It reported Operational EBITDA of $14 million in Q3 ($9 million Q3 2018). However, with the core business still facing strong headwinds, it is difficult for an outsider to see any value in the business.

# Why Bulls Smile After Midterm Elections

> Volatility is heating up in October, with some big drops for stocks late last week. Now let’s put things in perspective. The S&P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn’t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row—one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.

> “Some pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&P 500 was higher a year later every single time,” said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.

> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.

# So “Sell in May” Didn’t Work This Year?

> Not so fast. The answer is: We don’t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow’s and S&P’s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ’s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. 

> The market’s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it’s down 5.0% at yesterday’s close. 

> The past two days have reminded everyone of October’s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October’s scary record. 

> “The term “Octoberphobia” has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don’t get whipsawed if it happens…. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.” 

> October isn’t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let’s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it’s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the “Sweet Spot” of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. 

> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ’s Best 8 Months. 

> In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud “should I sell?” And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.

2068,The Chicago Cubs Name DraftKings Their First Official and Exclusive Sports Betting And Daily Fantasy Partner Chicago Cubs and DraftKings Also Plan to Pursue Flagship Retail Sportsbook at Wrigley Field,355,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ils3c2/the_chicago_cubs_name_draftkings_their_first/,30,"“DraftKings Inc. (Nasdaq: DKNG) and The Chicago Cubs today announced that they have joined forces to make DraftKings, America’s top rated mobile sportsbook app, the Official Sports Betting and Daily Fantasy Partner of the storied MLB franchise.  The multi-year deal includes a plan to pursue a first-of-its-kind sportsbook at the iconic Wrigley Field, with online access available in the surrounding Wrigleyville area. The planned DraftKings Sportsbook at Wrigley Field will include a best in class entertainment experience for sports fans in Illinois. Although sports betting is now legal in Illinois, the development of a retail sportsbook would require approval by the City of Chicago. 

“This is truly a historic moment, as we are thrilled to align with the renowned Chicago Cubs franchise and iconic Wrigley Field to provide sports bettors in Chicago with a revolutionary sports betting experience,” said Matt Kalish, Co-founder and President, DraftKings North America. “As two organizations that share a mutual passion for innovation and a commitment to excellence, we look forward to working in collaboration with the Cubs, an organization steeped in tradition, and making our presence felt in and around Wrigleyville.”

“DraftKings has been a great partner for a number of years and we are excited to expand this relationship as sports betting grows rapidly in Illinois,” said Crane Kenney, President of Business Operations, Chicago Cubs.  “An increasing number of sports fans want to integrate sports betting into their game experience, and we’re excited to be one of the first to engage in developing a retail sportsbook at a professional sports venue.”’

2071,DID WE MISS THE BOTTOM?! How are people this impatient.,348,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g1m6uy/did_we_miss_the_bottom_how_are_people_this/,283,"My mind is blown that so many people are convinced they missed the bottom and this is the end of a recession. Do people seriously thing recessionary bottoms happen over night? Take the last two bear markets of the 2000’s as an example.

The Bear Market of 2000-2002:

Start: March 27th, 2000
Bottom: October 9th, 2002
(31 months to bottom)

The Bear Market of 2007-2009:

Start: October 10th 2007
Bottom: March 9th, 2009
(17 months to bottom)

There has yet to be a recession that’s bottomed out within the first couple months of a market crash. This includes any and all recessions in modern history. Look at any recessionary period in the 1900’s to 2000’s and you’ll find the average time to bottom to be longer than a year. Even the flash crash of 1987 (Black Monday) took longer than this at 3 months to bottom.

Likely the bottom has yet to come and it’s much more likely to happen in many months or even years from now. Keep this in mind if you’re one of those people that thinks they’re gonna time the market.

Edit: to the people saying “BUT THIS ONES DIFFERENT”, that’s what everybody has thought about every other recession ever.",2020-04-15 17:03:23
